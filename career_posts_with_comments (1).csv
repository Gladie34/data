,,Culluh,,,,,Just don't let your company take advantage of you. Know your limits and your self worth.
,,HarleyOhio,,,,,"Congratulations on your achievement.  Save as much money as you can for a rainy day, always be on time, don't goof off, but also dont let them take advantage of ya."
,,ittybittybutwitty,,,,,"My advice would be positive attitude, show you care about to company , their reputation, culture, etc.
Get involved! Volunteer or attend company events. 

Networking is key, make sure you build strong relationships with those in your company. No matter their position!

Good luck‚ò∫Ô∏è"
,,KingVargeras,,,,,I once worked 80 hour weeks for companies that pay this. Once you have the right experience there are companies that will pay 6 figures for less then 40 hours a week. Keep working you‚Äôve got this.
,,Acol9884,,,,,I say great job to you
,,Internal_Metal_1227,,,,,Hell it's not crazy money but you are in a decent position especially depending on where you live. You are making enough to live and still have some left over try to save as much as you can(though no shame in treating yourself every once in a while either) and work up to better paying jobs. And don't forget that once you have the experience from this job if they aren't treating you right or refuse to give you raises after a year or two you can use that experience to go somewhere that appreciates you more.
,,Joezepey,,,,,Congrats on the perseverance!
,,nayeh,,,,,"Hey, I'm proud of you internet stranger.

Don't stop there - reserve some time in the week to study and learn new skills so you can push your career potential."
,,howsoever_,,,,,"My thoughts in no particular order:

1. Learn to be pretty damn honest. If you don't know something or don't understand, ask around and admit that. Otherwise you'll go years never learning it and feeling dumb.

2. Overall, it is a good attitude and personality. Just be someone people like to have around. 

3. Don't spread yourself too thin. It's great you're down to work hard and excel - but you need to make sure you're not burning yourself out or getting stretched too thin. Take your mental health seriously. 

4. Learn to say no. You're not doing yourself favors by fucking up 6 projects instead of excelling at 3. 

5. Market yourself. Put your name on projects and do whatever you can to get your name out there. 

6. Record a list of accomplishments. Your manager wants to give you a raise, but they need to be able to advocate for you. Give them as much info as you can. I keep an excel files throughout the year where I keep track of key accomplishments, skills earned, awards/recognition, expertise, etc. Come salary negation/year end reviews, make sure they see what you're bringing to the table."
,,Dudeman-Jack,,,,,"Good for you dude‚Ä¶.I started out making $40,000 a while ago and now up way into the $200‚Äôs.  I hope you end up making way more than me!"
,,AshDenver,,,,,"Remember to do well and aim for / express interest in a career path / promotion but if nothing happens in 2-3 years, look for a promotion-level job at another company for a significant increase (more than the 3% per year you‚Äôre likely to get.)"
,,,,,,,Thanks guys for the support and amazing tips I love it üíï
,,Individual-Score-965,,,,,"Work at a ""normal"" pace, or even a little slower than what feels normal. This sets expectations at a manageable level. If you overachieve, it sets that bar higher and it will make things more difficult for you.

The best way to get a promotion is to job hop. Raises will be 3% maximum, promotion might get you 10% if you're very lucky, and might just get you a new title and more work for no extra pay. Gain experience, keep your resume fresh, and hop to that next job for $60k. We're all counting on you!"
,,,,,,,"Use this opportunity to find a way to jump to about 60k minimum. Dont settle for 40k thinking its a great place. It may be an improvement, but its still not enough."
,,Exact-Permission5319,,,,,$100k is the new $50k so you are still way behind the median. Know your worth.
,,Crime_Dawg,,,,,No offense but 40k isn‚Äôt flashing money level at all. In many cities that would be poverty.
,,yoosernaam,,,,,Bot posting
,,ironbassel,,,,,This has to be satire‚Ä¶
,,UpsetCattle1327,,,,,"I‚Äôm happy for you because you‚Äôre excited but it‚Äôs not enough. I was making $36,000 working 29 hours a week as an assistant while in college. Now after graduating with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree, I‚Äôm working 40-50 hours a week for $36,000 with a quarterly $1,250 bonus if performance metrics are hit. All while my boss frequently reminds me of the very high amount of money they make. I‚Äôm looking to get out now.

I guess the point is, don‚Äôt give your life away for almost $40,000. Here‚Äôs what I think: self study, keep building new skills and obtain knowledge. Make sure that you can show that you are a value add. Be sure that you show that you can leverage experience and knowledge. 

Employers want the most out of you for the least amount of money, that‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt get too comfortable at one job. I‚Äôm now going to do my third interview for a job that pays double the one I am currently at. 

Live within your means. If you‚Äôre at home with your parents then stack up cash. Open a high yield savings account, money market account or a brokerage account invested in money market mutual funds to combat inflation. Take advantage of a 401(k) if you‚Äôre employer matches, if they don‚Äôt then open up a IRA or Roth IRA. Do your homework on what type of these you think would be best for you. An IRA uses pre tax earnings and taxes are then deferred. A Roth IRA uses after tax dollars and will allow for tax free distributions in retirement.

Don‚Äôt go out and get a new car just because you make more now. I‚Äôm still driving my used paid off car, which I don‚Äôt really like. Many people are car poor and don‚Äôt realize or care about it."
,,Otaku-San617,,,,,Find something that‚Äôs really important but no one wants to do and become an expert at it.
,,MissMiaBelle,,,,,Congratulations! That is awesome.  Be proud of yourself.
,,Limp_Carpenter3473,,,,,"Work hard, be dependable, be coachable, show extreme accountability, take pride and ownership in your work, maintain a good attitude and see what happens!"
,,Physical_Anybody_748,,,,,They‚Äôll try to take advantage and beat you down just work hard and keep a good attitude. Trust me. Their version of working hard is‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ slavery. Trust yourself too.
,,Chicken_manure,,,,,"Don‚Äôt show all your cards at once if you want to move up the ladder. While it‚Äôs great to be a star and an excellent worker. It‚Äôs very easy to be taken advantage of when they know they can pile on more work and keep the same pay. Do a good job and meet all your goals but don‚Äôt do anything extra.  The worst thing is getting compliments. Which I know sounds weird but just be aware. It‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúhey your doing a great job‚Äù then ‚Äúhey I should be paying you 10$ more for this hard work‚Äù

Congrats on your job. Love the motivation and dedication. You will be great, just stay optimistic and always seek new opportunities. Take anything people say as grain of salt until it actually happens. Business is business at the end of the day. I think everyone gets burned at least once. But you will find your navigation"
,,Icarus-8,,,,,"As someone who makes more than $140k a year, I am incredibly proud of you. Keep on your grind and go back to school for more $$$."
,,TimeTravelingPie,,,,,"really earn the promotion without arrogant entitlement.  Basically, don't think just because you've done a good jo for 6 months that it automatically means you've earned a promotion, then get mad and leave.  There are a lot of factors at play in any company that dictates that.  

With that being said, if you are a good worker and go a long time without a promotion or advancement, I'd recommend taking your experience to another company that will start you higher or at a higher level."
,,nocanola,,,,,What country are you in?
,,sewkrates,,,,,Participation in meetings is almost always what I‚Äôve seen make people stand out. Managers like engagement.
,,TheMagarity,,,,,Sign up for the 401k and get the max contribution from the employer match
,,UsualHour1463,,,,,"Congratulations! The best tools available to you are free: Be on time, or even a few minutes early. Be polite to everyone. Don‚Äôt be a gossip. Make eye contact and be pleasant as much as possible. If you really want a promotion, spend a few dollars on some better quality pieces of clothing. I don‚Äôt mean be dramatically dressed, but wear good quality shirts and shoes and take care of them. Don‚Äôt over commit and volunteer all the time. But when you do take a commitment, meet it."
,,Revolutionary_Arm907,,,,,"Account made 4 hours ago, I smell a troll"
,,MNReddit_Lurker2,,,,,"Congrats. Not knowing your situation, don't be afraid to work hard if possible. Assuming that's hourly, taking on some extra overtime if it's available and you have the time can quickly turn that 40k into 50/60k+ per year and earn the respect of your managers. Do be cognizant about your limits though and don't let them take advantage of you, don't be afraid to say no. That was an issue I had early in my career."
,,-Anne-,,,,,"Congrats!  
Make sure you keep your resume updated and improve your skills.  
Promotions tend to vary, sometimes you have to apply, sometimes they offer if you meet certain quotas and other times they don't have any promotions."
,,SomeGuy0072,,,,,"Best thing I can say is: network. Get to know people around. Reach out and make connections. When you leave this job, that 40k is gone, but those connections will endure. 

Congratulations and good luck!! We‚Äôre so proud of you! (Weird coming from a redditor)"
,,Doherty710,,,,,LMAO
,,Zestyclose_Ad2224,,,,,Put yourself first in your life. Look for training for your next move.  Congratulations we are proud of you.
,,RizzlinoGo,,,,,"Get sleep, pack lunches, pack water, buy ear buds and a music subscription without ads, buy a portable battery charger for phone, nail down reliable transportation that's consist and reliable, don't talk to much at work unless required, don't kiss ass or small talk with people but smile and say hi. Don't voice any opinions that can stirr shit up."
,,stevenmacarthur,,,,,One bit of advice I recommend: start putting that money away for retirement! You're already used to living on less than you're now making; start saving it so you don't get used to spending it all...you'll also pay less in taxes every year.
,,Hungry-Loquat7943,,,,,"1. Be consistent with your timeliness 
2. Do not miss deadlines and priorities; be reliable and over deliver 
3. Ask for more responsibilities 
4. Ask for feedback on your performance and be open to receiving it and making changes 
5. Build relationships with your coworkers 
6. Communicate; if life happens and you need more time for something or support ‚Äî ask but in advance. No one likes excuses after the fact. Proactively communicate."
,,WalmartDarthVader,,,,,"Congrats, but plz give the bare minimum to this company $40,000 is peanuts and nobody that pays that much deserves a 110% effort."
,,rwds138,,,,,"40,000 a year aint shit hahahaha  your not one of the people who are gonna be flashing you money because you know what its like making 20,000 a year? News flash you still aint gonna have money to flash at 40,000 hahahah this is hilarious, so funny i thought it was a troll post at first"
,,befish2,,,,,"Don't forget to (subtly) promote yourself along the way.  You can do a lot to shape how you are perceived in the workplace, which is what leads to promotions.  Also, be likeable."
,,Dowork001,,,,,"Congrats!! 
Stay true to yourself, maintain your beliefs, and have integrity! You won‚Äôt be taking advantage of!"
,,m915,,,,,"With absolutely no context around the job description or job title, I‚Äôd simply recommend to show up for work and do your job"
,,Beneficial-Sock-1817,,,,,"Don‚Äôt work that hard bro, they‚Äôre not paying you $500k or anything. Work enough to get your job done, don‚Äôt kill yourself working over $40k, seriously you will regret it."
,,NoTransportation2899,,,,," Very few people fall right into a high salary. There‚Äôs usually several steps. OP just took another step up the ladder‚Ä¶

Congratulations!"
,,Unfair_Traffic_5886,,,,,Don't stop there keep pushing yourself and goodluck
,,apt_3592,,,,,"That‚Äôs awesome, good for you!! Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing because it seems you‚Äôre on the right track. Keep working hard, be a nice person, have a want to learn and stay out of the drama some places have and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get promoted sooner than later."
,,BOHICAcadet,,,,,Where are they paying this at?
,,Knew2Much,,,,,Keep your budget that you currently have. Same lifestyle and such. By all means improve the stuff that was total crap. Look up lifestyle creep and don‚Äôt do that. My wife kinda forced my hand after a new job and we‚Äôve been regretting it ever since.
,,profpartner,,,,,"Hey I don‚Äôt want this to come of rude so please don‚Äôt take it that way! I own a company and I do wage cost analysis a lot since I care about my employees. 40,000 a year isn‚Äôt bad money, but what that breaks down to is $20 an hour 40-50 hrs a week. That being said depending on where you live that‚Äôs not considered a livable wage. For a livable wage your 40,000 should allow you to pay rent by yourself, afford a $500 a month car payment, and allow you to save between 250-500 a month towards a rainy day fund. If your apartment is $1,000 your income for that needs to show $3,000 a month after all other payments. To me $45,000 is the lowest I start employees with commission available if they sell over 50,000 a month. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short. If there is room for growth then fantastic!! If there isn‚Äôt and you work hoping to receive raises every year it will be a longggggg time before you hit the $50,000 a year threshold there."
,,stopjef,,,,,"Be loyal to yourself, not your employer. Look for a new job at a different company every two years and network, network, network. You will only make substantial gains going to a new company. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, kick ass now, but take care of your self first."
,,LabRat_SC,,,,,Only go up from here!
,,cnation01,,,,,"My situation was very similar, here is what I suggest.
Keep yourself familiar with supervisors and management. Don't get wrapped up with co-workers who complain about how the company is run and who is running it. 

Certainly do not involve yourself in these employees underhanded, passive-aggressive behaviors towards the company and management. There is always some that do this, maybe even several who do.

Don't call in and show up on time everyday.

Take initiative to get things done and do them well. Also, volunteer to take on extra duties. This will get you noticed and make you stand out.

Don't complain about the company or it policies. These come from HR or corporate and your immediate managers/supervisors have no control over it.

Your co-workers won't like you, they will call you a kiss ass behind your back and probably try and make your job harder. Keep your eye on your future and don't give that any of your time.

It's lonely at times but I'm greatful for what I've accomplished.  I have a nice house and live a pretty comfortable life. I'm not rich or anything but I am comfortable. 
Just keep looking forward and don't let anyone drag you backboard.

Good luck."
,,Sailor_Mouth_Momma,,,,,"Definitely avoid lifestyle creep, but pay yourself first. By that I mean put as much money as you can into an investment fund. Acorn is a great app for this. If you‚Äôre young, set the app at aggressive or moderately aggressive and automatically transfer money into it every month. Again, if you‚Äôre young you have the magic ingredient of time that will make investing worthwhile. You‚Äôll be amazed at how much you have in just 10-15 years."
,,,,,,,"Do your job and be reliable. But don‚Äôt express your excitement for the amount of pay. Act like it‚Äôs just a normal salary for you. Ask for raises during your reviews, etc."
,,SwanProfessional1527,,,,,"Set boundaries and understand it isn‚Äôt about working hard. It‚Äôs about providing value. 
Working hard only gets you more work; providing value will get promotions."
,,DaRealBagzinator,,,,,Try to still live your life as if you have a 20k a year salary and not 40k.
,,Octabraxas,,,,,"Save as much as possible. You never know when you‚Äôll need it. Also, be on time, be respectful, and double check your work."
,,fromfreshtosalt,,,,,"hard work pays off, but it goes both ways, for bosses and employees."
,,Mr_Randerson,,,,,"Save your money. You can't be manipulated if you can pay your bills without them. also, 40k is alot right now, but you'll want double that eventually. Start considering how you can take your savings and invest in your own come up, like starting a business or something similar. 

If you have a boss, you are not free. Consider being an entrepreneur."
,,b7uc3,,,,,"Congrats! Aside from the normal 'work hard' and be a good teammate advice (which is good advice): learn to identify and solve problems at your company. They can be little things. 

Like if you and your coworkers have to fill out a form in MS Word and the form is broken and it wastes everyone's time. Maybe someone made it 15 years ago and nobody has bothered fixing it. 

Learn how to make forms on youtube and fix it! Your coworkers and boss will love you for it. ...and keep doing little stuff like that any time you see something that isn't working quite right."

,,StepEfficient864,,,,,Stay above the shit and below the shine for longevity
,,Bluefiaze,,,,,"Real Talk here. You want to quickly move up to 100k a year?

This certification is super cheap, and in 6 months you'll be certified as an entry level project manager almost anywhere.

,,sigmonater,,,,,"You‚Äôre in a good position financially for creating a new budget. There are people that make 5x the amount you do and still live paycheck to paycheck because they‚Äôre big spenders. Since you‚Äôre used to a smaller budget, don‚Äôt fall into the trap of spending more just because you can. You should keep your current expenses where they are but put money away for different things with the higher income. Look up high yield savings accounts and create different ones for different things (car fund, house fund, emergency savings, etc.). I have all of mine set up for auto transfer on payday. If you want to start saving for retirement, head on over to r/bogleheads and learn how to invest in a Roth IRA without paying an advisor to do it. If you rely on a car for transportation to work, I would prioritize that so you don‚Äôt put your income at risk.

Having your personal priorities and affairs straight flows over into the workplace. If you‚Äôre able to make good personal habits, you‚Äôll make good work habits. If you stress about things at home, it will show when you‚Äôre at work. I say this from personal experience. 

Take this example: I had car problems last year - tons of expensive repairs where I couldn‚Äôt save to buy a new car. It got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt drive it. I stopped driving it for a couple months, had to rely on someone else to get to work, and cut my expenses in every way possible so that I could get something new. It wasn‚Äôt the company‚Äôs problem. It was my problem. But it showed and my boss sat me down and had a serious conversation about whether my head was in the game. I ended up getting a new car and the stress went away. I learned my lesson and now put $100/week into a fund for anything to do with my car (insurance, tires, repairs, oil changes, and eventually a new car)."
,,Heffernan84,,,,,"I‚Äôm proud of you, great job! Since you are used to living on $20k, I would highly recommend saving and investing if you can. If your job offers any kind of retirement benefit, sign up for it. If the company offers to match your contributions to a certain percent, make sure you are investing at least that much, or you‚Äôre basically missing out on free money. Your future self will thank you."
,,manofandonamission1,,,,,Congrats buddy. Keep working your way up
,,cmhtoldmeto,,,,,"Congratulations! A new start is exciting.

Give yourself a moderate cost of living raise, but save, save, save as much as you can. When eligible, check into your company's 401k plan, if any. Don't make any major changes like moving into a bigger place or getting a new car, etc., at least for six months.

Keep learning, be helpful (but not a doormat), show up on time, and most importantly take care of yourself. Guard your free time and get enough sleep. Best of luck to you."
,,privremeni,,,,," Now, and with every subsequent raise, increase the amount you are putting in your savings BEFORE you increase your standard of living. Do the same for 401k/RothIRA. If you don‚Äôt, you will piss the money away. If you do, you will be incredibly thankful to yourself in 15years."
,,WillyNillyLilly,,,,,"Tips: be kind to everyone. Stay out of the drama. Learn as much as you can and dry to develop a career path. 

Switch complained every 2-3 years for big pay jumps. Loyalty doesn‚Äôt mean much anymore for pay."
,,RSBuckz,,,,,"I went from being  a manager at a Carwash only making $18,000 (plus tips) last year. now I‚Äôm at a office job doing Entry level IT work for $40,000 this year. Life‚Äôs comes at you in mysterious ways."
,,BabyElephantWalks,,,,,Use this money to go to college
,,BingBong022,,,,,How do you survive on 40k let alone 20k? Like God dammmm. Doordash drivers make 50-60k
,,Third_Shed,,,,,Congratulations! Don‚Äôt let this new higher salary dissuade you from pursuing raises and promotions! It‚Äôs easy to get complacent and not realize how the market rate for your position has gone up.
,,MichiganGrown,,,,,"Worked for a company and showed up ten minutes early everyday. Boss loved it, I was the only person doing that with 200+ employees."
,,Hello_Friends_2023,,,,,"Congrats!  Try to keep living like you are only making $20,000 and bank the rest of the money for both essentials and fun!"
,,Panta125,,,,,40k? Welcome to poverty.
,,UselessInfomant,,,,,Promotions are a fairy tale. You need to change jobs if you want more pay and promotions.
,,merd3,,,,,Meanwhile I feel impoverished making 500k+ in a HCOL city after Uncle Sam takes away 50% üò¨
,,heartbh,,,,,"Good luck man, $40,000 is hardly enough to live on now.  I remember when I was young i was always told $40,000 and you can support a family, however that is a lie now."
,,Edwardian,,,,,"Knowledge is the key to promotion.  A hard worker that just does what he's told is great, but a person who understands WHY things need to be done a certain way, and how that ties to the rest of the organization is someone worth promoting."
,,protomatterman,,,,,"Wow ignorance really is bliss. Idk what to tell you. Here's a small nugget for you to chew on. You're losing some social welfare benefits. And now you're paying more taxes so you're paying for those benefits for someone else. Also paying for war, vax mandates, bank bailouts, etc. So really it isn't as much as you think. Feels good liven' in the USA doesn't it?"
,,thegoalisW,,,,,My advice would be stay there for a year or 2 to learn some skills and then change jobs again for a pay raise. 40k is just the starting line. I went from 46k a year to 80k a year by hopping jobs and moving up each time
,,,,,,,"I complain about not being able to break through $25K a month and into $30K-$50K month ranges, but seeing post like this keeps me level headed and motivated. You got $40K a year. Next is 65K, then 84K then 100K and it just keeps going up brother. Like a video game"
,,,,,,,"Stay positive, be curious, and ask questions. Understand your team's purpose, goals, objectives, and where it fits within the organization. You should be aware of the cross-function teams that you might be working with to get your team's objectives completed. Understand all the processes your team is involved in and all the systems you will be required to use."
,,Your_Daddy_,,,,,"When I was in my 20‚Äôs, my goal was $50k by time I was 30, and I got there. Then it was $60k by 40, and got there.

Now I‚Äôm shooting for $70k by 50, should be able to get there.

Hardly rich or anything, but when goals are achievable, it‚Äôs satisfying when you accomplish them. I went to college, but dropped out with no degree to speak of."
,,Coldshowers92,,,,,When you make over 60k in some area in the U.S it‚Äôll feel like you have something otherwise the costs of living will run you up.
,,aclgetmoney,,,,,"Step 1. Get what you can from the company. Knowledge and experience. If they aren‚Äôt willing to promote you and pay you what you‚Äôre worth. Then move on to the next company with the experience you‚Äôve gained. 

Step 2. Repeat. Until you‚Äôre making 6 figures. 

Step 3. Keep expenses low and invest in real estate. 

Step 4. Start a business or side hustle that will eventually allow you to step away from the 9-5. 

Step 5. Between the investments and side hustle/business you‚Äôll get to enjoy your life on your terms. 

Hope that helps! Definitely easier said than done but we all have it in us. Action and consistency can get us there. Good luck!"
,,zRustyShackleford,,,,,"Congrats!

While working for a promotion is great and having clear goals is the key for success, always keep your eye out for the next move outside of your company. Sometimes, it's best to move out to  move up. Don't sit around and wait on an employer if you don't have to...."

,,Stovetop_Cookie,,,,,"Tip number one. Remember when you made 20,000 a year and remain humble

Tip number two. Live like you still make 20,000 a year and stack the rest. You never know when you‚Äôll have an opportunity to invest or start a business and you‚Äôll be glad you save that money. 

Source.  Experience and personal screwups."

,,NatalieBGoulet,,,,,"First, congrats!! About getting promoted, keep a list of all your accomplishments and any tasks/projects you take on outside of what you were hired to do.

,,dezie1224,,,,,Congrats OP!!
,,walkonstilts,,,,,"Sadly, the most proven way to get promoted and get good raises is to get a new job about every 2-3 years on average. 

There is value in loyalty for your marketability, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth always keeping your eye open. 

I‚Äôd advise set yourself a significant jump, say to maybe $50k or $60k, and keep your eye on jobs that pop up in that range. You never know if one wants you, and even if they treat you okay, you‚Äôd be a fool to stay at a company making 40-45k for several years when someone else values you 20%+ more. 

For now enjoy this good opportunity, but don‚Äôt convince yourself it‚Äôs the only one you‚Äôll ever have."

,,hidden-jim,,,,,"Stay away from anyone, ANYONE, who seems like they don‚Äôt like their job. At least for the first year while you‚Äôre building positives with your co-workers.  They‚Äôll point out everything wrong with the company and you‚Äôll not be able to un-see it. This could have the potential to burn you out quicker and cause you to drop performance at work."
,,Doodoss,,,,,"You got this man! Moving on up!

And one way to find out how they take advantage of you is simply by just looking around. My partner recently applied to a job and was told they were definitely overqualified and suggested a different position but partner denied it as they didn't feel comfortable in that just yet. 
So the job came back with an offer at the bottom side of the scale and partner said they were expecting the higher end as they were overqualified had all the experience plus more. The HR individual started talking back about how other employees have been there for 15+ years and don't even make $30k so they don't see why they would budge. 
Partner told them maybe they shouldn't advertise a salary they can't meet and to give their own employees a livable wage. 
That was a major red flag"

,,DuffyDomino,,,,,"Congrats on the new job.

Tips:

It's not what you know, it's WHO you know.

When you get your paycheck, hold it up in the air, and say...."" We are even"".  You owe the company nothing, and the company owes you nothing, and they know it.

Get an education.  Take night courses.  It shows you are preparing for your future.  Also, on your resumes as time goes on, that attendance to college will be a big plus for you.

I always say a person should start a company.   Just try it.  Failure is OK.  Not everyone has the $$ to do that, and in your case, it looks like you are not there yet.  But do try if you can without jeopardizing your new job."
,,AdvanceSimple4352,,,,,Nice job! Remember that at any job visibility is what gets you promoted.

,,Killer_Panda_Bear,,,,,"40k is not enough money to ""flash"". Youre making the lower comfortable wage for a single person."
,,OpinionIsGud,,,,,Don't let your company shy you on your PTO
,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"It's great that you got a salary raise by landing this job. You should always strive to do this. Whenever you try to get another job your goal should to get paid more the 40k. The only time when you can waver is when you are changing careers, but even then, shoot for the same salary. 

Nowadays, high performance is not the secret to get promotions. It is part of it, but in addition your soft skills need to be on point. Be visible to those who have the power to give you a promotion. Be friendly and be proud when you achieve something great for the company and makes sure they know. Don't show off but humble share your success. 

If you are not given a raise by 6 months to 1 year and you are preforming well ask for it. Schedule a meeting and share all the accomplishments you have done in that time period and how they have benefited from them. Then ask for a reasonable raise based on the companies revenue, your experience, and the location. 

If you have a good manager who cares about you and mentors you ask them what you need to work on to get the next promotion or raise. 

I know you will work hard and get those promotions! Please let us know hen you do. :)"
,,hahawhatfor,,,,,"Congrats. Not sure of your age. But while you are there jump at every opportunity for training or continued learning opportunities.

,,oluwamayowaa,,,,,What job is it ?
,,bmcclan,,,,,"I've been up and down these comments and no one has said this but you seem young so I'll say it.  In most cases you'll see an increase of around 3% each year when staying in the same position.  This doesn't account for nor keep up with inflation.  More companies than not would rather hire someone from outside of the company for that promoted spot since they can give them the title but pay less than they'd have to pay you (I saw this repeatedly across multiple companies). 

In today's work market the best thing you can do is work a job for 2-3 years then start looking to change companies.  If you have good references you can likely start the new job at what you'd be making after another 3-4 years with the current.  Rince, pepeat.  Loyalty isn't paid for anymore, as someone else said the company wants the most work (the most results) at the absolute lowest cost - that's their job as a business.  Being promoted is often held as a carrot to get people to do the promoted job or work more hours while not actually getting the new paycheck and title.  Just keep that in mind.

Do your best to only increase your lifestyle by 20% even though you are making double.  Keep your current vehicle until the wheels fall off - cars are always an expense and some people don't mind a 600-800 payment but if you can keep it at max half of that the extra cash goes a long way.  Unless you can afford a life of luxury, your car is just a tool to get you to and from work, that's the only job it has.  Screw savings accounts for anything over 10k.  Get a financial advisor who can grow your money rather than watching it sit.

Congratulations on your next step!  I remember going from 20 to 40, then 60 was the goal, then 100, then started my own business to completely remove the income ceiling, hiring my own guys and having them get insanely excited bc I pay them VERY well, almost double what most in their positions make. It feels great to get to the next step and I solute you sir."

So I‚Äôm curious, are you guys actually able to make it by in your own place at 40k? If so what are you spending habits? Do you have nice QoL activities? Just trying to figure out if you‚Äôre a little off or I‚Äôm extremely bad with money. Maybe a little bit of both?"

,,Beyond_Interesting,,,,,"Save money and work within your job description. Work hard! When your boss starts asking you to do things outside of your job description, make note of that for your performance reviews. If they don't have them quarterly or semi annually, or annually, ask for one at least every 6 months.   
If they're asking you to do a lot, ask them for a promotion and salary increase during your performance review.  If they say no, ask them what the timeline is and what you would have to achieve to get a higher salary.   People who are busy get more work, but you can leverage that for promotions. Have fun!"

,,Move_mountains21,,,,,Probably somewhere in the south. I live in Oklahoma and living on 40k a year here is doable.
,,alligatorsinmahpants,,,,,No...there should be wage transparency at work. It's protected by law. The only people who don't want that are crappy employers who try to silence their workers so they don't have to pay fairly. Just don't be a dick about it. If it comes up that you're making more than a fellow worker support them in their efforts to demand fair pay. Your employer literally can't retaliate due to this. And if they try it's an open and shut case for wrongful termination.

,,Johnny3653,,,,,"Once you have your finances in order (how much you spend, what your spending ceiling is), it‚Äôs quite easy to see different ranges that people can have for job pay. Having lesser pay doesn‚Äôt mean they are not utilizing their full potential or are lazy, settling for less. Life is how you make it, what you find enjoyable and spending within your means."
,,,,,,,"You are very bad at money. You should only have all bills add up to only 50% to what you bring home in that month. 30% is free money to do whatever and 20% goes into savings. Where people mess up is the 50%.  They make dumb mistakes by getting expensive cars with monthly payments that far exceed even their own rent/mortgage.  I teach my kiddos that if you can't save up and buy a car in full....no monthly payments...then you don't get a car. Period.  That way your 50% can go to rent and fun things like gaming subs, or steaming TV and other luxories. You can still change. It's never too late."
,,Internal_Metal_1227,,,,,"I mean to live just completely worry free yeah you may want to be around there but 40k for a younger person starting out. In my state that's enough for me to spend $60 a day on food(which I never actually would do but I exaggerated for worst case scenario. Also learn how to cook on the cheap it will save you a hell of a lot of money over eating out every night) pay my rent and other bills, and still have a little(roughly 5-7k depending on some miscellaneous expenses left over to start investing and use how I see fit. Now I will say it would be easier for me since I have an older car that is paid off and alot of things I've taught myself to do so I don't have to pay others but yeah at 40k I could live off of for a couple of years. The biggest thing is you want to make sure you pick up experience and skills though and learn how to negotiate a salary. Once you have those you can start getting more. Maybe never in the range you are at but you obviously want a much more luxurious lifestyle and probably live in an area with a much higher cost of living than I do which is why I pointed out the depending on where you live. Seriously though the only way to make a good living at some point depends on how well you can get people to like you and also learning how to negotiate whether that is higher pay or lower prices."
,,buttstuffisfunstuff,,,,,"Little bit of both. My coworker makes about $180k a year and lives off of $25k and his mortgage is like 80% of that. He hasn‚Äôt bought a new car in 20 years, only ever buys one new pair of pants and one new polo shirt for work, once a year. New pair of tennis shoes every 2 years. He‚Äôs had the same pair of shoes for work for over 10 years and just gets then resoled. Always shops what‚Äôs on sale and coupons for groceries. Eats out probably 4-6 times the whole year.

,,alihasadd25,,,,,That‚Äôs good to hear! Would you share someone‚Äôs routine/job/living situation/ marital status on 40k? One of the way we generally can spend less money on the coasts is living in walkable areas so you don‚Äôt have to have a car or get a bunch of roommates. It‚Äôs of course cheaper if you have a partner but we generally don‚Äôt settle down until our 30‚Äôs so it‚Äôs a bit harder for that reason too!

,,GottaMoveMan,,,,,"Transparent pay = higher pay for everyone involved. You are getting paid less than your worth, I can almost guarantee it"
,,redmage753,,,,,"That's not living paycheck to paycheck. You can literally cover everything and still enjoy some fun stuff for the kids. You're pretty out of touch with the average American if you think you're living paycheck to paycheck.

Paycheck to paycheck means you're not saving anything. There is no % to retirement. You're covering bills and maybe not even all of those. a 500 dollar emergency would bowl you financially over. You need the next check to cover your previous bills, not your future ones. 

Paycheck to paycheck doesn't mean ""I can cover all my needs, some wants, and just wish I had some more play money.""

You're living a life of luxury relative to most Americans."

Work is not to make friends, it's to get a job done. Having friends is great. But if they want to be assholes because they are pansies then two can play at that game. At the end of the day as long as the work gets done correctly and efficiently, nothing else matters. If it's that big of an issue, why didn't they themselves speak up? No, they went behind your back and made it a real issue. And if the whole group is acting weird all of a sudden because of it, then that most likley means they are talking shit behind your back and swaying everyone.

I hate to be so matter-of-fact or cold, but your staff needs to learn how to take a joke. If I was you, I would have just laughed when the guy said what he said, and said something like 'Well we'll see who bails you out next time you need it!"" Laughed some more, and shrugged it off. 

It was probably you being stuck not responding that even made your staff think it was anything but a joke. 

Again, I don't want to come of callused or anything, but this really seems like a huge overreaction (for everyone) and I would HATE to work for a company that makes a huge deal out of nothing like this. 

Just my PERSONAL OPINION."

,,Feeling_Direction172,,,,,"Have a team meeting, let yourself be vulnerable, and explain everything like you have here. You are a human, you felt caught off guard. It didn't just happen to your team, it also affected you. Stating this and opening the floor for a discussion will bring everyone back together and allow for airing grievances so you can move on. Do not let it sit and fester."
,,Scared_Entrance_8180,,,,,"Its not your job to apologize, this is actually an HR issue lol

Is HR telling you to do their job?!"
,,jbbbbbbbbbbbbb1,,,,,Your fragile snowflakes need a reality check. The fuck did they want you to do?  Put him on blast in front of them?  They need to grow the fuck up and stand up for themselves. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt stand up for me‚Äù is a cowards statement. If you didn‚Äôt like it man up and fucking say it.
,,kevroc,,,,,"You're overthinking it.  It was a joke in bad taste on their part, you tried to water it down.  No big deal.  Just because they are overreacting doesn't mean you have to overreact as well.  That's why HR is there."
,,Richard-Roma-92,,,,,"Lots of üêë in these replies.

,,CT-91,,,,,"I think I was right. I think you are middle management .You come off as a human carpet for anyone who makes more money than you to walk all over you.

,,Square-Requirement82,,,,,I had an issue similar to this and mostly it comes to timing. Something that did help is to provide an event for them and take that opportunity to apologize in a personal setting. In my case I did a team breakfast (donuts and coffee) in one of the conference rooms. It gave me the option to really apologize to them and got them to open up more.

,,WallStLoser,,,,,"Your team probably assumes that you are taking all the credit for everything and aren't properly sharing what they are contributing. 

Is the team ""meh""?

How did this person get that opinion? 

Are you the only one they interact with directly?

It's not at that exact moment you needed to say something, I think it's maybe a culmination of everything you may have said prior to that. 

If members of the team aren't great, you need to work harder to get them where they need to be or replace them. If they are, you need to be finding ways to share how they are contributing to the success more often. 

This can't be fixed with words or a slap on the wrist by HR. 

And no doubt ... maybe you need to find a different place to work yourself ... away from this type of person."
,,bun_stop_looking,,,,,"if your staff doesn't understand that this is a way more difficult position for you to be in, having to make snap decisions and going with the one that you knew wasn't going to get you in trouble with your boss, then your staff sucks or needs to up their emotional intelligence.

,,PsychoGrad,,,,,"It‚Äôs done, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. The laugh out of nervousness is understandable (I‚Äôm a nervous laugher too) but is easily misinterpreted as agreement laughter.

,,Own-Engineer-7290,,,,,"Each of the girls that he insulted are equally at fault for not speaking up. It is workplace abuse training 101 that the first step in the process is to (in a safe manner) tell the abuser that what they did was not okay. While you should have also told him that his actions were not acceptable, each of the other girls also had that same responsibility.

I will preface that speaking with the guy could have been done in private and wouldn't need to be a battle in the trenches.

I say this is abuse training 101 as I have literally just read through my company's abuse prevention standards today as a part of my onboarding process. If that kind of training was not provided to you or the other employees, then that is the fault of the business."

,,InteractionNo9110,,,,,"Most admin managers I know are powerless as managers.  You have no power to do or say anything against Partners.  You are just there mostly to keep the staff running smoothly. 

They lost respect for you since you didn't take the moment to stand up for them.  The best you can do now is take it as a learning lesson.  You can call a meeting and apologize, and leave it at that if they do not want to discuss it further.  And the next time it happens, get some balls and have a prepared response to stand up to him.  Or anyone else who thinks it's funny to be passive-aggressive to the staff."
,,XenoRyet,,,,,"You move forward with your actions.  You know he's an asshole, so he's going to say an asshole thing in the future.

So either you push back and defend your people when he does that, or admit to them that you can't defend them against this kind of thing and why.

Basically, you have to choose whether you're on their team or his, and no fault to you either way, as there are impacts to your own job to consider as well, but you have to make the choice and then live into it."
,,Soft-Strawberry-6136,,,,,Theyl get over it
,,jasoncombs28625,,,,,He is a partner and therefore an owner of the company.  It was not your place to confront him in front of the staff.  The proper course of action would have been to talk to your staff after the incident and assure them that what he did was not appropriate and then schedule a meeting with HR to discuss the problem.  Sounds to me like he will eventually no longer be a partner.
,,IamTheWalrus001,,,,,"I was in a situation where we had this one dick director with a reputation as such.  I told me staff to just be their professional best selves no matter how he behaved and not to let it bother them since no one knows his personal story or why he is a dick.  Rather than focus on him, to just focus on our own behavior.
And btw, there is still no excuse for poor behavior but he was a dick since his wife was battling cancer and his daughter came out and he had a hard time accepting that."
,,Sudden-Motor-7794,,,,,"They'll get over it.  I'd wait for opportunities to do something nice for each of them.  Not going overboard kissing their ass or anything, but just going the extra mile past where you would once or twice.

,,Doctor_Ummer,,,,,"Only way to fix it Is to call the partner out in front of them. 

But you gotta learn how to take shit and give it back."
,,YourAuthenticVoice,,,,,"WTF were you supposed to do?

Jump up and demand he apologize?

Honestly, the ladies should be understanding of the shitty position he put you in as opposed to being mad at you for being put in the situation.

Fuck him, he's an asshole, and fuck them for not supporting you when you were clearly put on the spot.

I had a similar thing happen to me when I was the only one to wear an employee badge to a staff meeting after everyone recently being told to do so.  Made me feel horrible.

Sorry the guy is an asshole, I hope he stubs his toe REALLY hard.

Good luck!"
,,Chewybunny,,,,,"What I would do, if I was you, is treat your staff to a surprise breakfast or lunch, and let them know that you appreciate them.   
Do not mention the person, or that you are doing this because of that. that instead it is YOU who is appreciating them."
,,jinkies3678,,,,,Sounds like partner was joking and you are all wound too tight.
,,ASmollzZ,,,,,Everybody is so damn sensitive these days. It sounded like a decent joke to me.
,,Throwawayhelp111521,,,,,"To u/Bun_Bunz

I've worked in law firms like the one OP described. HR obviously thought what the partner did was so offensive that he needed to apologize to every one of the people he insulted. That does not happen every day. Clearly, they were concerned that he could be accused of creating a hostile work environment. Nobody knows employment law like a law firm."
,,Adventurous-End5745,,,,,"Not cool, but this still is small potatoes compared to what goes on in law firms."
,,PumpikAnt58763,,,,,"You apologize.
You show them recognition - to them as a team and in front of upper management.
You tell them you knew you messed up as soon as it happened and you hope to never let them down again."
,,entechad,,,,,"So what happened is called Nervous Laughter. Check it out. 

What you do is continue on the path that you have always been on. Do what you have always done for them. Do not do more, which will make them think you are taking responsibility for this jerk. Do not get upset because they are treating you differently. It isn‚Äôt their fault. They are butt hurt because you are their queen and they expected you to bitch slap the dude. This is obviously not an acceptable expectation. You have just been so much for them. 

All you can do from this point forward is be strong. Move forward. 

I would bring this to other rooms like the following, for more focused advice.

,,OkSomewhere6760,,,,,Eh it‚Äôs not like you said it.  I‚Äôd just let them know you were kinda in shock and apologize for not confronting it then.  They don‚Äôt really have a right to be mad at you imo.
,,HexBladeWarlock,,,,,"Manager (27F) here, more bluecollar though I believe as I'm more or less a foreman. If this happened, and I felt the mood shift, I'd speak up. Otherwise I'd do the same and I'd address it as follows. 
It was awkward, I was on the spot, I didn't agree with it either, people are people.
I guarantee each of your employees has been in your uncomfortable shoes before and if you're to be humane and consider their feelings they should also understand that you are a human first and manager second. 
Try to also be more ready to defend your group in the future with whatever means are appropriate."
,,Southern_Orange3744,,,,,"Edit : lots of bad advise op , please don't follow most of it because these people have clearly never actually dealt with these situations

Life lesson here , take it seriously. 

I know many people are saying talk back to the partner but that requires a lot of social capital and burns it forever.  This is career suicide

What takes 0 capital or opportunity for retribution is delegating the praise to your team in front of them . 

""Thank you , but it's my team that does all the hard work that deserves the praise!"" 

Team will be happy , partner will take the hint or later realize what happened , you can even talk with him privately on the matter and he'll likely appreciate the swift move. 

  honestly this is pretty standard in the management world , and many people on this post need to skill up on how to deal with conflict."
,,tomatocrazzie,,,,,"Welcome to the joys of middle management!  You were between a rock and a hard place.  I probably would have handled it the same.   I would take your group out for lunch or HH, off-site, and take a minute to explain the situation.  Yes the guy is a jerk, but he is a partner, and as a manager, I have a foot in both worlds and sometimes that puts in awkward situations and ask them to cut you some slack."
,,Wesselink,,,,,"I would consider discussing situation with HR and your boss. Perhaps they can help guide you through this.

My gut instinct: I would take each employee out to a nice lunch (one on one - company paid since HR knows this is an issue created by the company) or just one on one meetings during the normal work day (lunch preferred as an olive branch).   Have a heartfelt conversation.  Explain that you‚Äôve never experienced a situation like this before.  You were taken by surprise in the moment by his comments, and you were honestly frozen on how to properly react given that it was a public setting and the guy was your superior.  If you explain it in such a way that they understand you‚Äôre only human, and sometimes humans don‚Äôt have the perfect (or even acceptable) response immediately - especially given the uniqueness of the situation.

Make sure they know you‚Äôve learned from the situation.  And while hopefully nothing similar would ever happen again, you‚Äôre more on alert now so you‚Äôll be better prepared to handle something similar of it should happen.

I would have the conversation with everyone - even the people who didn‚Äôt speak with HR.  It‚Äôs likely there are people (everyone?) who were bothered by it but just didn‚Äôt say anything."
,,travelingman802,,,,,It sounds to me like he was trying to make a joke
,,throwaway2343576,,,,,"You didn't do anything wrong.  A managing partner made a bad joke and they got offended.  You are not the defender of the realm, you work for him.

,,Birdie121,,,,,"There was a power dynamic at play, and lots of people (especially women) laugh as a reaction to discomfort, trying to diffuse the situation and not escalate things. This isn't on you, it's on HIM. In the future, you would ideally say something like ""I think they're doing a great job!"" but I also understand the instinct to freeze in that situation.

,,Accomplished_Tale649,,,,,"I work in an admin team, OP, and unfortunately, this didn't come out of nowhere. He's probably been making degrading comments for awhile and how many times have you stepped in on them? 

You know better than anyone the sh!t admin teams have to go through for very little recognition and pay off and you still let this happen without following up with him. The problem here isn't what he said so much as what you didn't do. The shift you feel is the trust being broken. Because in reality, with a man like that or anyone who relies on hierarchy, they are relying on you to speak up for them because otherwise they won't be heard because dicks like that don't have time to hear the Meh admin team because they don't care.

You've signalled to them that you're willing to listen to him chat shiz about them as long as it doesn't affect you. Is that the truth? No. But you didn't indicate to them that it wasn't the case. 

You need to apologise and be real with them and admit your mistake and the next time be hot up on it or you'll find a very disengaged team until they're ready to leave because like I've said, I've worked in that team and fortunately for me, my crap boss was asked to leave."
,,HolyShitIAmOnFire,,,,,"Why isn't HR dealing with the partner? The partner (or the other partners) should care that this one person throws around his weight in this asshole way.

For the subordinates to pin this on you in this type of situation is juvenile.  You shouldn‚Äôt apologize for what he said.  You didn‚Äôt say it or condone it. If you treat your staff with dignity and respect and you appreciate them and you legitimately and sincerely show your support and appreciation through acts and deeds and words then they don‚Äôt have an argument.  

People do the best they can and I hate it when subordinates sharpshoot bosses like this. I mean it‚Äôs not like he berated the staff for 10 minutes.

Nothing wrong here. He showed Appreciation toward you.

>""and as for the rest of you..meh‚Äù

Looking past the guy being labeled an ""a-hole"" there's nothing wrong with an individual venting his frustration.
The guy may be acting out due to him feeling alienated.

This is also during a Lunch.

>I nervously laughed it off because i honestly didn‚Äôt know how to react and parts of me didn‚Äôt feel comfortable telling him off.

Even if this is all true you shouldn't feel guilt. You did nothing wrong.

>A few hours later, HR called me in to let me know that number of my staff were upset and pisst about what he said.

>I did a check in with them, apologized for what he said, saying that it wasn‚Äôt cool at all, and they said, ‚Äúgreat, but it also your reaction and not speaking up to defend it so it made it seem like what he did was okay‚Äù

With all due Respect but they all sound like a bunch of children overreacting.

You didn't have to Apologize.

>I feel extremely awful and i feel a shift with them now. They told me they didn‚Äôt want to discuss it anymore so i stopped talking to them about it.

You shouldn't feel awful. They all sound like spoiled pouty bratty children.

>HR made him apologize to each of them, not sure if it was sincere or not,

Go figure! That guy didn't have to Apologize either (a-hole or not). It truly does not matter.
This is all spilled Milk.

>Not sure how to move forward.

Put this behind you with the new knowledge that you work with extremely fragile porcelain people.

With also in mind that you weren't in the wrong nor was the guy that showed Appreciation toward you (on Monthly Staff Appreciation Lunch Day) and shared an opinion with everyone else.

You two shouldn't have been shamed into Apologizing.
You two Truly did nothing wrong.
The others were in the wrong including "" HR "".
An overreaction is an overreaction and that my fellow Human was a HUGE OVERREACTION.

Let them know that they are valuable to you and to the company, and you are working to build your skills to support them in every way possible. You may even consider bringing in a trainer to work with your entire team - it‚Äôs an important skill for everyone to have."
,,bilvester,,,,,Was it Donald trump?
,,Administrative-Ad376,,,,,"As difficult as the position was, nervously laughing it off was not the way to handle it, as you saw. Had you taken a moment to think of the impact, on an appreciation day no less - like what if he'd thanked everyone else but said you were meh, how would you have felt?

Too many in management treat staff like a revolving door of expendables. You said you felt a shift - that was your staff realizing you were full of shit."
,,RedditOR74,,,,,There is a time and place to discuss the actions of the people above you.  Doing it in front of the other workers would probably not been that time as much as people would like to think so.  None of them spoke up.  Why?  Because it wasn't the right time.  Office politics and schoolyard politics aren't the same.
,,analyticDropseed,,,,,"I've been there too, and it's tough. Don't be too hard on yourself. Try talking to your boss honestly, showing you're committed to fixing things. Look for solutions and offer to make amends. We all make mistakes, but your willingness to improve will count. You got this!"
,,GudToBeAGangsta,,,,,They wanted you to be confrontational? Wtf.
,,sic0048,,,,,"I'd just like to point out that none of them reacted ""in the heat of the moment"" either.

‚ÄúAs for the rest of you‚Ä¶.meh‚Äù ‚Äúnah the rest of them is great.‚Äù Stuff like that‚Äî-you don‚Äôt have to challenge him but letting your people know that you don‚Äôt share his views will go  a long way.

,,akamelborne77,,,,,"Sometimes it boggles my mind how little empathy people have. In a perfect world, after he left you would have said something like:  I'm not totally sure what that was about, but I wanted you to know that I appreciate you guys.""   But even that is risky business.  

If he finds out you said that, is he going to feel like you are undermining him?  It sounds like he has some real leadership blindspots and doesn't care how his word or actions impact others. 

All that being said, I feel for you. I don't really know how you could realistically ""stuck up for them in that situation"".   

Did HR talk to him too?  Did he have to apologize? If not, that is 100% not cool."
,,rockylafayette,,,,,"After watching 6 Seasons of Suits so far, I consider myself an expert in the world of corporate law firm office dynamics. I‚Äôm like Mike, I don‚Äôt need to go to law school to be an expert‚Ä¶. So my advice is I think you should do whatever Donna would do.  Cause that works out for the best every time."
,,Firehouse-Therapy,,,,,"The staff should be able to realize the situation your in and understand how awkward that situation is for you.  Your in a bad place where your in a position above them, so you have an obligation to stand up for them, but also in a position where you could have your career destroyed by a managing partner.  He knew exactly what he was doing by doing what he did, he was trying to cause a rift between you and the staff and it worked."
,,CurlinTx,,,,,Your staff is over sensitive. Did they do a ‚Äòmeh‚Äô job? If so they need to take the criticism. Why can‚Äôt they handle a little criticism. Sorry but I was in Hospitality and worked from waitresses to hotel management. This little comment would not even register as hostile. Your team are entitled weenies.
,,ObiOneToo,,,,,"This is the challenge of the middle manager position. Remember, it‚Äôs not a popularity contest. You represent the firm. Protect your staff where it matters. Protect their positions, keep their work aligned with their jobs and abilities, reward production, and champion them PROFESSIONALLY. 

If a more senior person is a douche, try to shield them from that. Be a filter. 

In the future, in a similar situation, you can attribute your success to the team. When a seniors gives you a compliment in front of the team, try something like, ‚ÄúThey deserve the credit.‚Äù"
,,ParticularOkra4539,,,,,"Ahh that's awful, definitely seems worth apologizing personally to the team and talking with the partner to let him know that wasn't OK"
,,Slide_Mammoth,,,,,"Incoming down votes...

Your staff needs to learn how to take a joke. That is such a harmless bs comment that he made, for you staff to go to HR and not just complain about him, but also complain about how YOU handled it, is ridiculous.

I'd be questioning whether my employees had an issue with me if they reported me to HR for something so petty that adults should really be able to shrug off."
,,Stunning-Plant4368,,,,,"This is weird, and I don't know why you're in trouble. Honestly, if someone had said that to me, it would just take me a few moments to even understand what they meant by ""and as for the rest of you...meh"" and why they were saying it. I would have been kind of dumbfounded for a bit. I think that's a normal reaction to have."
,,dayzdayv,,,,,"Folks are saying you‚Äôre overthinking this and while that may be true, as a manager you should consider the perception of your team here. 

If I were in your shoes, I‚Äôd try and get 1:1 time with individuals. Acknowledge that you have heard reactions to the interaction and you want to hear how they feel. Acknowledge your care for the team, avoid throwing anyone (especially your partner) under the bus. Make it about making your team feel heard. Reassure them you have their backs, and that you will apply knowledge here moving forward. 

Managing is hard, we have to be diplomats essentially. Make your team feel heard and do what you can to restore eroded trust."
,,k-dick,,,,,Recognize they have a point and promise you'll be firmer with him going forward. And then do it.
,,siMChA613,,,,,"When he walked out or before, how the hell did you let him shit on your people without, almost immediately, saying something along the lines of ‚Äúthey‚Äôre meh to you, but I love them/their hard work‚Äù something like that! 

If you were afraid to say something like that, well, I'm sorry that the rest of the managing partners are so shitty they leave you in fear.

Surely, while your team was busy having 1 or more people get in touch with HR, you could have messaged you team and said ‚Äúi wish y'all got direct praise from my boss(es) some time, but I hope you know they only way I ever get praised by them is because y'all are so good at being ‚Äúmeh‚Äù as some would say. 

as for fixing it, can you talk with other managing partners about some firm of employee appreciation? It's justified by the fact that HR took action plus from law school or elsewhere, some may recall that a proper legal process is that apologies are often paired with remuneration ... really isn't the entire premise of modern law firms to move money that undoes harm OR/and symbolizes/achieves justice ‚öñÔ∏è?"
,,SlimChance9,,,,,"It sounds like he was trying to make a joke but it fell flat because he‚Äôs an asshole who uses jokes to put others down.

,,Car_Prize,,,,,"Wow, if the partner says that to their face, imagine what they say behind people‚Äôs backs. Poor taste in joke, yes, but it‚Äôs not a joke if no one is laughing.

Don‚Äôt feel bad, calling out a partner then and there wasn‚Äôt the right TPO. Now that HR is involved, hopefully there‚Äôs a write up, and then should it happen again, you can say ‚Äúnot a nice comment, remember when‚Ä¶?‚Äù"
,,Electrical_Review_81,,,,,As a manager you can never really win. You did the right thing by apologizing and owning up to it. Just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing if it‚Äôs right by the firm and good for your people.

When my partner and I got the opportunity to both WFH despite living in a 1bd we immediately figured out arrangements, got a smaller desk for the bedroom so that we could be separate and not bother each other and we swap places to respect each others schedules and such."
,,Sad_Consequence_3269,,,,,Fire the staff
,,jFailed,,,,,"The partner screwed up and HR is trying to shift the blame onto you to protect the partner. If you had said something, they'd probably be calling you insubordinate. Middle management means you take it from both sides."

,,johnthestarr,,,,,"As a manager, one of your main responsibilities is to fight for your team; get them the resources they need, ensure they are able to work effectively, and make sure everyone knows that it‚Äôs due to your team that you‚Äôve succeeded. 

The partner was a dick, but clearly he‚Äôs used to you claiming credit, rather than claiming credit for your team. What you could have said is ‚Äúthanks, but I‚Äôm really the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù one without my team. I hope the appreciation lunch shows appreciation not just to my team, but how much I appreciate partners recognizing my team‚Äôs hard work.‚Äù"
,,Badenguy,,,,,"I dunno what your situation is but I know most all the support staff in the many law firms that work in my building are all contractors, pretty much so they can be let go or asked to be relocated at any time for just about any reason. Dudes a douche, what ya gonna do?"
,,AuntEyeEvil,,,,,"Ever seen a lose/lose situation?  That was it.

Buy your team lunch, thank them for making you look good in the first place, apologize that you were caught off guard, seriously - that's probably the first time the dude said 'thanks' in his life and it threw you for a loop, and subsequently handled the situation in such a subpar manner."

,,Silent_Slip_4250,,,,,"You were probably shocked and stunned at what he did. I think it‚Äôs pretty reasonable to not know how to respond in the moment.  Share with your team that you were as pissed off as they were but didn‚Äôt know how to respond immediately since he is a partner.  Commit to them that you‚Äôll continue to do your best to advocate for them, and acknowledge that sometimes we all fall short.   

You‚Äôve got this."
,,palmtrees007,,,,,"You did nothing wrong. I work with a person I worked with at another company. I steer clear from her because she is a weird and entitled nightmare. She gets upset if her boss doesn‚Äôt go the extra mile for her. She has unrealistic and ridiculous expectations of what she wants from those around her in the work environment. 

She will talk a big game but cower down quickly.

,,Toodaloobro,,,,,Those god damned Louis Litts.
,,boss02052000,,,,,"I understand your manager and I do believe you could of said something in private to the partner. But in all honesty I think that‚Äôs his way of joking. People are overly sensitive. I am guy and if my boss said that I would just forget it within the same day. I tell the staff grow up. What you 5 years old. Can‚Äôt take a little side comment. He is insensitive. It‚Äôs the real world, you are owed respect not much above that."
,,CT-91,,,,,You can tell reddit is full of either spineless middle management types or the most annoying people you could ever work with who really believe that the person who's signing your check gets the treat you and talk to you any kind of way and those small little comments. Betray a lot of the mentality of most of these people. But again I get why Reddit is the most spineless place for any kind of workplace arbitration because over half of them are like trained little dogs for the company. And how dare anyone get mad at boss's jokes? Like I don't think there is any other social media site where people just tell you to happily eat their boss's shit because they're the ones bringing it to you on the plate
,,jonnyskidmark,,,,,"Buy your crew margaritas Friday night and apologize again

,,Jayman694U,,,,,"That is a difficult situation indeed. Maybe the best way you could have handled that is to warmly tell the boss ""Ohh come on now üòÅ! I wouldn't get anything done without my wonderful team supporting me!"" after he said that. You would have had their back in a non-confrontational way with the boss. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say I suppose."

,,audaciousmonk,,,,,"I don‚Äôt think you can fix it. Your team has visibly, and publicly, witnessed that when push comes to shove you won‚Äôt defend or protect them. 

Even worse, this wasn‚Äôt even a subjective issue like a business direction / change that was undesirable from the team‚Äôs perspective‚Ä¶

No this was toxic workplace behavior, someone on the leadership team no less, who displayed outright contempt and disdain for your entire team. 

I don‚Äôt think you realize how serious this is. You may lose team meme versus who aren‚Äôt already conditioned / Stockholm syndrome to this behavior and are able to change jobs. 

Even if no one leaves, why would your team be open with you or rely on you? Personally, you‚Äôd be burned for me as a manager / mentor.  I‚Äôd do what was needed to either line up an internal transfer, obtain an external position, or make moves to be able to do either in the near future."
,,hungry_lobster,,,,,You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Those people expect you to have an altercation in front of the entire crowd of people? That‚Äôs wild to me. Don‚Äôt apologize. Explain yourself to whomever you NEED to explain yourself to but i think you‚Äôre good.
,,Odd_Leek_1667,,,,,"I think the right response after he said ‚Äúmeh‚Äù would have been to turn to your staff, and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what he says, I value and appreciate you and I know you do good work‚Äù, hopefully while asshole was still within earshot"

,,Karma_Cooler0122,,,,,"You talk to your staff about rising above. I am the COO of a large law firm, covering the east coast. Personalities abound, Because of the cultural and social differences that come with large organizations. I would meet with the person and see if there was truly any sincere aggression meant from the comment or if it was a badly placed joke. Then ask why and offer lunch with the troops to break the ice and let everyone get to know each other, basic level setting. Then, based on his response, you move on. Rising above and communicating is a key to surviving large firms. Stress to you people that you are always available to talk to, HR is great, but they should always feel comfortable coming to you first to discuss the issue. Engage in 1:1 with your staff to drive a comfort level and reinforce the positives to your team and to the partner."
,,philp2021,,,,,I would have handled it differently.I always tried to put my crew first when I was doing marine construction.I learned that if you want to be large and in charge then you have to speak up both ways.I got burnt out at times.you get pulled in two different directions.Boss on one side and the crew on the other.AND YOU IN THE MIDDLE.Now your going to have to gain there support back.Its going to take a minute so hold the course cause one wrong word or action could tip the scales.

,,QuietProfessional1,,,,,"This is going to be unpopular, but anyone ""offended"" by that has issues. 
Everyone knows he is dick, so his BS shouldn't affect you. Unless your are unsure with your work. And if that is the case then those offended should find out if they are not cutting it. Maybe the guy expects you to do more than your getting paid to do, and if that is the case ignore his stupid ass, or ask for a raise.
Add for what the OP needs to do, nothing. Nothing at all, you could ask him to not make statements like that, and explain why. But more than likely he will do it more often."
,,Far_Strike_4106,,,,,How did *you* mess up? Not sure I get it.
,,Dorzack,,,,,You had a deer in the headlights reaction. It took you by surprise. HR should be having the conversation with the partner. They created the situation.
,,Dick_tint8779,,,,,"Don‚Äôt touch on it too much with them. We always strive to fix things, but the damage is done. You will only make it worse by trying to talk your way out, because it is seen as a salesman‚Äôs pitch of friendship. Buy donuts and bring them in, or buy pizza at lunch for a week. Don‚Äôt let this situation happen again without at least looking a certain way/doing/saying something to whoever disrespects your team. You need your team as much as they need you; but the things they can do to mess you over are more numerous and troublesome due to their numbers. Nothing good will come from duking it out with either side. Just proceed from here with love and respect; and kindly remind others to do the same if needed. Work is supposed to be professional, not some high school hallway."

,,dopelunchbox,,,,,"Let it ride. Eventually, things will settle down. Sometimes inaction is the best course of action"
,,OGhurrakayne,,,,,"IMO the only reaction that you could have had was to respond with ""I couldn't do this without my team."". Correcting someone in front of an audience never ends well so perhaps their expectation of a reaction did not take into account how it would have played out. It is best to have those conversations in a 1on1 environment to let the team know that you did not agree with the comment and would be addressing it. When you do address it 1on1, you can say that you don't believe that was intentional but the team took offense to the comment and feel as if their work is overlooked."
,,tallerThanYouAre,,,,,"Go to him in private and say that you appreciate your relationship with him. Be positive and grateful. 

Ask his ADVICE about what you should have done to handle/avoid the backlash from the team. He will probably say something derogatory, but it won‚Äôt matter. 

Go back to your team and say that you heard them, went back to him, explained the situation and you hope with them that it will be better in the future. 

Then apologize to them for not standing up faster, it was a surprise and he is your boss."
,,Professional-Bus7285,,,,,"Navigating office dynamics can be challenging, especially when you're caught between higher-ups and the team you manage. Your reaction, while understandable, made your team feel unsupported. It‚Äôs essential now to rebuild that trust. Consider calling a brief team meeting. Acknowledge the incident, express your genuine regret for not speaking up, and assure them of your commitment to advocating for their well-being. Let them know that you value their contributions and feelings. Actions speak louder than words, so ensure your future behavior aligns with your commitment. Open communication and consistent support will be crucial in mending the relationship. It's all about trust and proving that you genuinely have their backs."
,,Tiny-Statistician434,,,,,"I'm not sure if this has already been said (so ignore my comment if it has) but the only thing you haven't mentioned is - have you personally apologized ?  
  
The person who made the insult has apologized, HR have evidently taken a view which is contrary to his and (while you say it makes you feel awful), you don't mention if you personally have taken them all aside and offered an apology.  
  
That's likely what they're waiting for (and an assurance that it will not happen again).  
  
You were in an impossible position but an apology will likely go a long way !"
,,CoolMaintenance4078,,,,,"Forget it and move forward. It's not your job to have your staff be your friend.

,,Catface991,,,,,"The partner put you in a bad spot.  HR handled things.  Because there‚Äôs already a paper trail and disciplinary process in place, I‚Äôd keep my mouth shut.  Continue to do your job and find other ways to show your staff they‚Äôre appreciated and valued.  
I don‚Äôt believe you acted immoral.  You were out on the spot.  If the partner left as quickly as you described, you did not have a chance to give a rebuttal.  Were you supposed to yell at him as he walked away? 
In this economy, keeping a job is imperative.  Your staff won‚Äôt pay your bills, guaranteed."
,,AutomaticBowler5,,,,,A good leader would have a conversation with him one on one. So how would they know if you spoke with him or not?
,,EimiCiel,,,,,Your staff has no clue about office politics. You did well in the situation imo. I wouldnt sweat it.

,,jzcommunicate,,,,,"Be honest, it caught you off guard and it was a hard situation to navigate. Now you‚Äôre working with HR to resolve the situation."
,,cituzenJ,,,,,"This was a ploy by an asshole partner to cause friction between you and your staff.  His public compliments of you were not in the least sincere, they were a set-up to hurt both you and your staff both personally and professionally in one swoop by generating friction perhaps even division between you and them.

As part of his needless attack, he was counting on his completely unexpected compliments to knock you off balance to nullify any retort you might have, thereby making you look weak in front of your staff. (Think of an attacker smiling at you, calling you by name in a cheerful tone, raising their right hand in salutation, then gut-punching you with their left when close)

Why would he do this? Assign any sicko excuse you want.  He's jealous you have a well-running dept. He needs to feel like he's Big Dog to make up for shortcomings he's painfully aware of and fantasizes about sexually dominating any put-together, in-control woman. He's an incel. He's a sadistic sexual predator. Whatever you like 

How can you address this?
Talk to your staff.  Explain what I just said....it was completely, entirely intended to hurt you and each of them, personally and professionally.. He sees what a great group you are and can't stand it. Why?  Maybe (probably) because he resents women in a management position and is intimidated by a group of women who work well with each other and with other men. Needs to see women in subservient roles. Why didn't you instantly  have some blistering come back?  Because you were completely caught off guard by his needless vicious attack out if the blue ..as I'm sure each of them have been caught speechless at times. Assure them, that does not mean you have not, will not address this. HR got an apology out of him, but that's not enough.  YOU need an apology from him..for his attempted disruption of your dept and sullying of YOUR reputation.  You need HR to investigate him for similar attacks, put downs, slights, esp those directed toward women not just staff but also clients.. Men like this ...those who enjoy humiliating women...are often sexual predators at worst or incels at best. Mention that in your staff meeting.  Ask your staff to report ANY conversation etc he initiates with them and they need to have the stock response, delivered almost robotically, ""You need to speak with...(you) regarding this.  I will report this interaction to ...(you).""

. Do NOT let up with HR.  He's a Partner, not God.  The fact there's an HR dept says there is some manner of employee governance and there's not a law firm on the planet that would want a sexual predator as a partner."
,,TreyRyan3,,,,,"You have a team meeting with a member of the HR Team. (They can tell you exactly what to say to avoid liability.) You basically tell them you dropped the ball due to the discomfort of the situation and if anything similar happens again, you will be the first one to report it to HR. He may be a managing partner but he is a huge liability for the firm."
,,Faithsgirl,,,,,"This is not a career ender.  I propose you (check w HR beforehand) & create an anonymous survey monkey form.  Tell your coworkers you feel sorry that they do not feel appreciated/supported & want to anonymously get their feedback on the work culture at your firm.

Once HR approves, send the form out, put the data together & present it to the partners, along with a few ideas of your own on cost-effective, meaningful ways to improve the work culture, based on the feedback you received.  Let your staff know that you appreciate their help in filling out the survey & that you are human, but you are actively looking to improve & want to be an advocate for them."
,,JustAGhost444,,,,,"I can only imagine how stunned you were after that little episode of ""Bosses Behaving Badly."" I'd cut you some slack for not being able to confront him when he said it. I'm sure there were ways you could have addressed it in the moment but honestly I'd be like ""deer in the headlights"" after something like that.

Talk to your staff (maybe with HR present), one last time. Apologize and assure that you'll do better moving forward. 
That you didn't stick up for them (something as simple as ""that wasn't kind"" would have been better than nothing) 
Own your mistake(s) to them. You stated they reported it to HR, but not that you did. If you didn't, you absolutely should have, and they need to know that moving forward, you will."
,,Healthy-Leg8205,,,,,"If you're the manager, you're the manager. You don't owe your employees an explanation. BUT if you want to be liked, talk to each employee individually. Even if they're still mad, they'll likely tell you they understand. And at the end of the day, you're all there to get a check."
,,mehmench,,,,,"I imagine you had to process what happened as it wasn't something you planned.

It's perfectly reasonable for you to have been in shock at his actions. It's perfectly reasonable that in the moment, in shock, you didn't have the capability to also defend your staff.

It's perfectly reasonable that his absolutely dreadful behavior left you speechless.

It's perfectly reasonable that your staff is pissed, it's even reasonable that they don't understand that you were left speechless.

Have a team meeting, include HR if need be and apologize to them about the fact that the situation completely caught you off guard and left you speechless. It's okay to apologize for your part even if your part wasn't that big EXCEPT from their perception. 

It's up to them to accept it but that toxic feeling that they have about the situation isn't your doing, it's that shitty partner's doing. It's reflected in the work environment and you can only do so much to insulate them from him."
,,PhallicB4ldwin,,,,,"On the face of it, it sounds like something you would say in jest to people you actually respected.  I immediately assumed it was sarcastic as I don't know anyone who would say that  seriously.

I'm not a huge fan of the workplace putdowns as ""much truth is said in jest"", but it really feels like that's what this was. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone else get this impression?"
,,niteguro,,,,,You should have told hr the man makes you nervous about losing your job.  HR is usually run by morons in my opinion.   They don't think at all and go by the complaints.   It's a shame how useless HR has become unless you are a minority even though the courts ruled affirmative action is unconstitutional.
,,Future_Dog_3156,,,,,"This is my take too. I would suggest talking to your team and apologize for not standing up to the team. What the partner said was uncalled for, the fact he complimented you is a credit to the hard work and support of your team. Acknowledge your mistake but I would also mention that you are working to improve your relationship with him on behalf of the entire team"
,,Ornery_Society85,,,,,You were in a tough spot and did not know how to react to his rudeness. Your employees should know you well enough to know that you were in an uncomfortable position and it was best you didn't say anything  back. They should overlook your reaction  or lack of I might say.
,,joaraddannessos,,,,,"You don‚Äôt have to be perfect, just be fair and keep your promises. Have a team meeting, apologize and step up next time and you‚Äôll eventually recover your team confidence."

,,EntertainmentLazy716,,,,,"This is my take on the situation, and honestly good for the employees who followed up with HR.  

I would recommend discussing the incident with your staff, apologize for standing up to them and that you've been brainstorming better responses next time he does this.  (because you know it will happen)....also, I would recommend that you encourage them to come to you or HR if they're more comfortable about inappropriate behaviors from this partner.

By not only admitting your mistake and acknowledging you have room for growth, but also being supportive of reporting inappropriate behavior to HR, you'll show that you're supporting them."
,,oneKev,,,,,Exactly. I was fired once when I defended my team from terrible accusations from an owner. You work at the company and need to be aware of situations. Your team should be more understanding. Why didn‚Äôt they defend themselves?
,,PumpkingLumpkin,,,,,So peaceful
,,DogAdventurous1,,,,,"Totally agree with this‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt blame OP if I were in this position. It‚Äôs only the fault of the partner, who put OP in a position where he would‚Äôve been forced to jeopardize himself."
,,CT-91,,,,,Pretty ridiculous that you'd suck the skin off of corporate dick as not to ruffle any feathers but little sniveling  coworkers like you keep your head down oike golden retrievers like you are the reason shit tier managers feel so bold. I'm okay with being fired for standing on principal. It's pretty good job market out here right now. I bet people like you are the ones who do that extra fake laugh whenever your boss says something
,,Feeling_Direction172,,,,,"Managing isn't about friends, it's about working for your team to keep them happy and productive. Whilst I do agree it was a bit much to expect the manager to jump to their defence, it is worth explaining how difficult that situation is and taking advantage of explaining through some humility to bond the team further."

You need to work on your reading skills. These people didn't go to HR because the partner verbally shrugged. He insulted them. The fact that HR made him apologize reveals how bad it was."
,,Accomplished_Tale649,,,,,"If you've ever been in that situation, it's not about what he said. It's that OP didn't stick up for them that is the issue. Because if a manager won't stick up for you when it comes to digs like that, will they stick up for you with the big stuff? 

We only get OP's side of ""we have a great relationship"" when in reality if it was that good they would have gone to OP instead of HR.

The truth lies somewhere in between, but you need to take whatever chip that is on your shoulder."
,,MOSFETBJT,,,,,This is the most logical and Coherent take. There is no reason to blow this up and turn this into a big deal. People are extremely sensitive and they need to realize that you don‚Äôt have control over what others say.
,,penpointred,,,,,100% ^^^^ like what the hell..how could the coworkers be upset that you didn‚Äôt confront a coworker on a bad joke?? And then taking it to HR. I have a long work history in a wide range of environments and those coworkers are being crazy petty.
,,CT-91,,,,,You seem like you suck the biggest dicks in honor of your company. How dare nobody want to deal with the stupidest college white boy shit all day at work I know guys like you just can't really comprehend that people are just there to get paid and not really to hear weak ass work comedy. But I do also think it's funny how you guys are the first people crying like a little bitch when you get checked on it the first time because you're just so used to being the dude at work who has people politely laugh at his jokes because he has people over them But seeing as how people like you whose whole reason for your existence is to work corporate and swallow as many nuts as you can from on high. Because God knows it's people like you who will kill themselves in their whole family if they lose their jobs. Because like that's all your personality and self-worth is compromised of. But not everybody really gives a fuck

,,,,,,,[deleted]
,,Haisha4sale,,,,,"awkward joke for sure. its a bad sense of humor but im sure his internal dialog is like, ""of course its so absurd I would actually feel this way that it will obviously make it a joke and thus it will be funny"". probably why this guy sticks to himself, he seems awkward."
,,Traditional-Panda-84,,,,,"A joke like that, coming from someone on whom you daily livelihood depends, isn't funny. Because of the power differential, jokes about workplace performance are never good when the boss punches down. We've had to deal with this at my office, and ""taking a joke"" is just bullshite. Even if the boss wants to think of them all as colleagues, the fact is he can fire any of them at any time, meaning his ""joke"" has an edge that most can't just ignore. Going to HR was the correct decision."
,,treblclef20,,,,,"I agree that it‚Äôs a huge overreaction, especially towards OP. But this comment is still hardly a joke anyone could really rationalize, especially when you‚Äôre in such a major leadership position. The guy is just a jerk and wielding his power. He had no concept how it made other people feel. It‚Äôs pretty clear."
,,onimush115,,,,,"I agree. When I read it, I assumed he was joking. I‚Äôve worked with managers with a very dry sense of humor and it can be hard to read if you aren‚Äôt overly familiar with them. Many people mistook them for assholes because they didn‚Äôt get the joke. 

I get that it‚Äôs not always about the intent of the person making the statement but the people that get super offended right away need to learn to not take every interaction so literally. If it sounds absurd, that‚Äôs probably the intention. It would be in very poor taste for someone of partner level to make a comment like that and not have it be in jest."
,,0pp41_D41suk1,,,,,"It‚Äôs only a joke when everybody take it as one, if others take it as an offense (which considering the fact that the WHOLE OFFICE is offended) I think not"
,,,,,,,[deleted]
,,ReformedTomboy,,,,,"It was a joke. But how these things are taken depends heavily on the previous relationship with the parties involved. If the guy has a habit of being rude and condescending this kind of thing isn‚Äôt going to play well at all. If he has neutral or even friendly relationship with the team it‚Äôs easy to take as a joke. 

It‚Äôs clear he doesn‚Äôt have a good reputation with them so they didn‚Äôt give him any grace (which is justified, IMO).  He should be self aware enough to know that. I don‚Äôt blame the team for the reaction. Where I blame the team is making it about OP when she was clearly put into an awkward situation. They should understand she probably didn‚Äôt want to fight or act out despite clearly disagreeing with the joke. Nervous laughter is a thing."
,,TrialENDErr,,,,,"This part makes it clear it's not a Joke 

""ne managing partners is a a total a\*\*hole and no one in the office is a huge fan of him. He and I are civil with each other and only talk when he needs something done."""
,,NoEntertainment101,,,,,"Maybe he meant it that way, but just think about this:  jokes are funny.  If no one is laughing, it's not a joke."
,,MisterNiiiceGuy,,,,,"I agree 1000% with this..

Especially, ""it was probably you being stuck not responding that even made your staff think it was anything but a joke."" The OP shouldn't feel guilty, but going forward she should just bust his balls on behalf of the others..

I'm sure there's resentment towards this guy, but these people are probably taking him way too seriously. He's a jerk off because he's likely from a different time. I'd honestly laugh at that comment, because it's obviously a joke.. the partner was probably expecting or hoping everyone would laugh at that.

OP, don't feel guilty.. you did the right thing."
,,LiteraryPhantom,,,,,I feel like this comment needs to be higher up. A lot higher up
,,TrialENDErr,,,,,"This sounds like a passe attitude. The newer generation knows that just because you give someone a paycheck, doesn't mean they have to eat your shit.

Managers are there to support their direct reports. Part of that entails sticking up for them when they are being attacked."
,,Throwawayhelp111521,,,,,"She's not overthinking it. I've worked in large law firms as a lawyer and there are partners who routinely humiliate people and get away with it because they have power. At least in this case, HR was able to make him apologize. That's unusual."
,,Feeling_Direction172,,,,,"If my team is upset then it's not a joke. The individual may have thought he was being jokey but in reality he was just being a jerk.

Managers work for their team, saying their team is ""overreacting"" is basically sidelining them, and regardless of what you think as their manager it's definitely a problem. You'll find your team harder to motivate and perhaps experience attrition if you have the attitude of ""you are overreacting"", you are indirectly confirming with them that you don't care and you are siding with a dude who both HR ***and*** your team feel is a pest."
,,feelin_cheesy,,,,,There is rarely a time or place for insubordination. A simple ‚Äúthey‚Äôre pretty great too‚Äù should have been enough in that moment.

If they thought it was inappropriate, then they should have the guts to talk themselves first before expecting someone else to talk for them. But they knew if they did talk in public like that to the partner, there's a chance that they would end up fired. I don't know why then they expect OP to jeopardize her job for them. Your responsibility as a manager is not resolving petty fights between your team and other groups ( that's the HRs job), your job is to lead the team and get shit done."
,,Throwawayhelp111521,,,,,"Not all lawyers. This partner, who is in a leadership position at the firm, was an asshole."
,,Own-Engineer-7290,,,,,"This is a very good plan for conflict resolution in a genuine way. Don't just wait for a generic meeting, though. Plan for something during the week, where you make it personalized. If it's just tacked on to another meeting, it may not feel as genuine. It would be okay to hold them for a few minutes after an existing one, though, if schedules are tight."
,,Feeling_Direction172,,,,,"You are basically normalizing deviance there. If your attitude is ""what do you expect, be grateful for the jerk employing you"" then you can look forward to a miserable team to manage. There will be talking behind your back, loss of respect, loss of trust, and all of a sudden you'll wish you'd stood up for them because you are now also miserable and hate going to work."
,,Throwawayhelp111521,,,,,She should apologize but shouldn't make promises. It may be hard for her to do that. It's important that her workers understand why.

I would‚Äôve told the partner to respect my team but not going to put blame on someone for not sticking up for me. Not being able to take criticism from an a hole that I can choose to ignore is way worse and more spineless than not risking your job for your team. After all OPs team isn‚Äôt going to pitch in on her bills if she sticks up for them and gets fired they‚Äôre just going to say ‚Äúdamn that sucks that dudes a dick‚Äù and then you probably won‚Äôt talk to them ever again.

I see your perspective but think rationally instead of being an incel, they‚Äôre adults that can stick up for themselves"
,,Revolutionary_War503,,,,,"Really? Why didn't any of the team immediately speak up for themselves? Because they expected their manager to? For me, if someone disrespects me or my work ethic, I speak up for myself, I don't let someone else fight my battles. It says a lot for the team to stay silent."
,,JLandis84,,,,,Challenging an owner in public is idiotic.   People that are mad at you for not doing something obviously idiotic are either idiotic themselves or acting in malice.
,,CT-91,,,,,"It's only a bit much if you don't expect your manager to be a completely spineless bitch and expects everyone to open mouth laugh at every shit tier joke your boss makes just cuz he's your boss. But that's exactly why these kind of people hated working from home because they didn't get to flex that power. I mean for a lot of these dudes they would blow their brains out if they didn't get the chance to feel like they were in some kind of paternal control of their workforce. Also coming here and expecting backbone from a thread of managers is funny. And always keep a few thousand held back I have cussed out so many managers and I have only ever moved up in pay because you have to be ready to fuck over your company just as quickly as they would fuck you over and all that bullshit about ""Leaving right"" is a scare tactic. Also, if your manager or boss is any kind of pro Elon that is the new red flag since they don't really have an original thought and need some weird CEO to model their persona on since Steve Jobs is dead just run."

This is why you should never really show long-term loyalty to any of these companies because like unless you want to try and compete against all of the ones that were in the same frat fingering each other assholes during pledge week.

,,ReformedTomboy,,,,,"If he‚Äôs constantly putting people down and has a reputation for being rude, then no it‚Äôs not ‚Äúso absurd‚Äù. My boss is like this. He will make jokes about the things he actually seriously criticizes people for. In that case it‚Äôs not a joke it‚Äôs mocking."
,,xch13fx,,,,,"No, it‚Äôs a joke when someone means it as a joke. If people misunderstand or take offense, then sure I admit that joke teller should explain or apologize. Why don‚Äôt we ask OP?

,,xch13fx,,,,,"Sorry I caused you pain. 

HR didn't remark that, her team said that. 

No, that's just not accurate. Nobody says negative comments to people as a 'test'. If they do that, that person is really out of touch with reality. The fact the partner apologized afterwards, is testament that he truly didn't mean it. If he meant it for real, he'd apologize for publicly saying it, but then ensure the manager deals with it.

I agree with you 100%, In my opinion, it was OPs mishandling of how to respond that caused the team to think the comment was legitimate."
,,xch13fx,,,,,"Does it tho? Maybe. I wouldn't fault you for thinking that. 

Think about this. OP is the person who originally was 'stunned' by his statement and didn't know how to respond. Wouldn't it then serve to think that maybe OP had preconceived notions about his intentions, regardless of what his intentions were? I'm definitely playing a huge devil's advocate here, but hopefully you get my point.

I've seen this from people 1000 times, so I trust my gut on this being a joke. You can trust yours and disagree, that's actually 100% ok. I was just giving my opinion, maybe I shouldn't have said it so matter of factly."
,,jbbbbbbbbbbbbb1,,,,,Then relegate yourself to being run over. The newer generation is socially stunted at best and need to recognize that the old adage ‚Äúyou have to stand up to bullies‚Äù is true.

OP is in a no-win situation.  Probably should have said something awful about the guy to her coworkers the minute he walked away to break the tension.

HR obviously thought it was a problem, and they asked the guy to apologize in person, which he did.

Your attitude makes you as much of a jerk as the partner, you now have equal contempt. Why side with a covert bully? I go to work to earn money, not to be treated like an idiot (as you said) by management. If these employees are not deserving of respect they should be let go, and rehire people who you can respect. I am so glad I work where I do, I can't imagine being surrounded by people with your attitude. I'd expect it in low paying shit shovelling work, but I am too old, and too qualified for this crap."

Right. I misread the post, and my previous rejoinder wasn't worth editing.

>Nobody says negative comments to people as a 'test'.

Within a few constraints partners at law firms do pretty much whatever the fuck they want.

>In my opinion, it was OPs mishandling of how to respond that caused the team to think the comment was legitimate.

Can also go to the guy in private and say ""The fuck was that?"" When you're a manager and in the boss' own words one he appreciates a lot, it gives one leverage to do that. I doubt I'd chirp back in public in a defensive manner but I think I'd certainly bring it up directly in private - since he likes me so much.

I disagree that nobody would ever test an employee that way. in certain industries it can be nice to know if anyone working for you has any real nuts, not just how to yuk it up with the boys at luncheons. I think some law firms can be particularly that way, being ""in touch with reality"" is a relative concept there."

I can work for my team as part of my contract with the company, just as customer service reps work for their customers through the company.

This is where you are normalizing the deviance, just because he's a partner doesn't make it ok to express contempt for the people building his business.

Why have a quick chat with the team after if what you truly think is ""well he pays your rent, deal with it"".

I wasn't present when this happened, and I don't think being able to confront a partner on the spot is reasonable, but a fast follow absolutely is. Thing is you can't be sincere about caring for your team if deep down you think they are overreacting, I have to assume these people are educated and reasonable people, they are probably just tired of this asshole showing contempt for anyone other than his management. Perhaps this has been building unaddressed for months, given the context of the OP's description it seems like it was a tipping point. Your attitude basically allows this sort of thing to build up, because you don't think it's a big deal. You normalized it because it doesn't affect you directly (the manager in this instance basically got a high five and in front of the rest of the team, the people who do the boots on the ground got a fuck you), and now it's a problem."

All this being said, that's why I 'blame' OP for why her team took it the way they did. Still, I don't think it's very nice for her team to put her in that situation. Just learn to take a joke, and stop getting offended by everything."

,,LiteraryPhantom,,,,,"‚ÄúWho cares if it was wrong for the staff to blame her‚Äù?

Ultimately, she should care. If they didn‚Äôt already know, they were just taught that going to HR with the same complaint about someone gets a result.

As someone else pointed out, if the entire team is now acting off put by her, they‚Äôre talking shit about her amongst themselves. How long do you think it‚Äôll be before the ringleader says ‚Äúhey, I have an idea‚Äú.

However she does it, that needs to be clipped.

I don‚Äôt believe she made a mistake. But that doesn‚Äôt matter. In fact it wouldn‚Äôt matter if I did believe she made a mistake.

At this point, I believe the best action would be to gather everyone up for a quick five minute pulse check and give them a brief opportunity to let her know if they are still dissatisfied. She can hand walk that person back to HR."
,,xch13fx,,,,,"So you want them happy and achieving career goals... Admirable. I might recommend you consider what all that entails, because this won't be the last time some wise-ass cracks a joke that 'they took offense to' and if they go and report every single one to HR, eventually it'll be one of their heads on the chopping block or making awkward apologies etc.. 

Just because your team feels a certain way, doesn't mean you just bend over and throw up penalty flags all over. Sometimes, you need to tell them how it is, and if they are overreacting, as their supervisor, I'd say it's your responsibility to manage those expectations.

I don't care what the power disparity is, I will do something about it.

I assume by this you are explaining to them that partners get a pass when it comes to being disrespectful and contemptuous to the people that build their profit.

So, are you saying, that OPs team disrespected her by going to HR? That's literally in almost every HR playbook in the developed world. You don't have to go to your manager, in fact, often can be discouraged from doing so to ensure transparency. Sorry, but this one kind of shows how green of a manager you really are. 

It was, in fact, completely a joke. I recognized it immediately. That joke, is said almost weekly, often more in numerous calls I have. ""Hey you good for nothing person, never helped me a day in my life."" Everyone laughs hardy harr harr, move on. 

No, partners don't get a pass for actual harassment, belittling, generally unprofessional behavior. I 100% agree with you there. The thing is, an adult working a career job needs to be able to navigate human tendencies. Those include, saying the 'wrong thing' or making a mistake and saying a joke in a way that other misunderstood it. Surely, something to be learned here, but that something isn't to go run to HR anytime someone says something off-putting. If they TRULY took offense to that statement, it probably means that deep down, they think they actually might be useless. If they really know they are putting in their fair share, they would have taken that as a joke, which is 100% was.

And if I were these peoples managers from the OP, I would have first told them all to relax and that it was a joke, and if they felt like they needed to go to HR that was their right, but that I wouldn‚Äôt be supporting it. Culture runs across departments and up and down the ladder. This kind of stuff is toxic to a healthy workplace just as much as real harassment and abuse is.

Let‚Äôs take work out of the equation. You are out with friends, and a friend of a friend you‚Äôve met maybe once before cracks a joke that rubs you wrong. What would you do?

,,No-Alfalfa5702,,,,,"if that isn't an age discrimination lawsuit,  i don't know what is."
,,SpareFullback,,,,,It seems like BS because it is BS. They're just trying to get you to take on more responsibility without paying you more and couldn't even come up with a believable excuse.
,,Jester-Black-9999,,,,,"No point in taking on more responsibility without a raise, I would refuse it."
,,Piddy3825,,,,,I'm not a big fan of accepting more responsibility if I'm not going to be adequately compensated for the position that the title entails.  Why accept a manager role when you don't make a manager wage?  Seems counterproductive to me.
,,flaskfull_of_coffee,,,,,"I'd walk, if anything you should get MORE not less for being younger. If they think you're good enough for the title then you're good enough for a raise."
,,flarbas,,,,,"They‚Äôre being stupid and possibly illegal and you should get a raise for being a manager, but you need to think big picture and not refuse a promotion because it doesn‚Äôt automatically come with a raise.  

Don‚Äôt overlook the benefit of having a manager title and experience, especially for being so young. 

You should be taking on the role and getting the experience and proving that you deserve the raise in the short term, advocating for the raise in the mid term, and preparing to use this higher title and experience to get a better job somewhere else in the long term. 

Some other things to be doing, studying up on how to manage. It is it‚Äôs own skill and not just a natural thing that you get to do when promoted. You are going to have difficulty managing for the first time, managing older people, and managing firmer colleagues. 

Don‚Äôt overlook this, this is going to be a challenge and you should read some books or take a course."

,,Apprehensive_Iron919,,,,,"If theyre really strapped for a manager you might be able to strongarm them by refusing to do it without a raise. They would likely have to pay much more for an outside hire. Either way you should start looking elsewhere because you will be underpaid. If you think they could easily pick someone else, then take the title alone and start applying elsewhere. Pretend they gave you the raise you deserve and base future outside salary negotiations on that number. Having increasing positions at the same company gives your resume a boost. Within a few months to a year you could leverage a salary increase that is significantly more than what you are asking for from this company. 

A good company would not ask you to do this, but you can still use it to your advantage."

They are referring to increase my pay from X with this promotion and told me it was because I would be making too much more than others my age, and I want to know how bad they are trying to screw me here.

> What would you say is a reasonable pay range for that role? What would you do if you were in my situation?



Make sure you send an email to HR start a paper trail. (BCC yourself)

> I was informed on Friday that I would not be provided any compensation adjustments for my new role because of my age. Please clarify for me what the company's policy is as it relates to calculating compensation based on an individual's age.

,,dgeniesse,,,,,Take the new job and gain the experience. Go back in a few months and use your success to ask for a raise. If you are not respected - seek new opportunities. But never pass an opportunity to gain experience that aligns with your future goals.
,,Blondie-Brownie,,,,,F-NO!  This is  like telling somebody over 50 that they can't get a raise because they reached a salary cap for their age.  Using your age as an excuse  is ridiculous. They are giving you the position because they think you will be believe them.  DO NOT! Many companies out there want to hire the young assuming that they do not know their value.  Similar to not hiring older people because they won't put up with that kind of Bs.
,,Spirited-Caregiver19,,,,,To be honest it‚Äôs probably a little true except for opposite reasons. They don‚Äôt want you to make as much as the older people. It‚Äôs the older people who get insercure when younger people make as much as them. Younger people don‚Äôt do that. I had a guy who made as much as me tell me straight to my face I make too much money because my degree got me a rate a dollar less than his.

Seriously though, decline the promotion. I might even decline if they were offering a slight raise because being a manager is a thankless crap load of extra work and responsibility within most companies. 

If they actually value you and see a future for you at the company, they'd express that with additional wages in my opinion."
,,Automatic_Tear9354,,,,,They don‚Äôt usually give big raises when you promote to manager unless you were at the entry level pay. The bump in pay from Analyst to manager is about 3.5-6% but a better bonus structure. Getting bumped up is good for the resume but not good for workload or salary.

But do not complain to anyone and do not rock the boat.  Just stick it out long enough to learn new admin skills and how to manage a crew.  Other may agree, but you weren't discriminated... Your inexperience was exploited.  Moving forward you'll have learned that your contribution carries a value to protect.  If you stay, I see you're only path is requesting a one year review or a new raise.  But you'll need to record every implantation and solution you put into play.  Tough spot.  But stick it out and don't burn the bridge.  Cool thing is now you can search for a new company on your terms.  You have income and time push your terms and walk away from the offers that don't motivate you.

I had already worked for the company for 5 years in the Production and shipping end of the warehouse, had mad product knowledge that you cant get in a college. I worked in the office for a year, enough to call it experience and throw it on a resume. Then left the company for more pay. I miss it a lot, great company with great benefits. But some new management took over and a CEO and they were just cheap as all hell.

,,Lord_Shockwave007,,,,,"Yup, you've been ""up-rooted"". Which means you've been uprooted from your nice, comfortable position that you were probably cool in doing (and probably very good at doing), to take on more responsibility, do more work, and put in more hours for less pay than the previous person because they had you pegged for being a sucker. 

Time for some soul/job searching. Because it's not going to get better. Even if the old manager doesn't want to come back, I don't think he necessarily wanted to be shifted to hiis new role, either. It's one thing to prove yourself in a role for a while without the raise to see if you can do it (common practice, not a good one, but common nonetheless and one that must be endured), but it's quite another to havve it be forced and handed a pile of horse shit to go with it."

Also, if you meet all the expectations for the position at the end of the 1 year, they will give you a bonus equal to what the full raise would have give you for the year (so, the other 1/2 of the first 6 months and the other 1/4 of the second 6 months).

I would not bother to renegotiate with my current employer, nor consider a counteroffer. I would not disclose current salary to prospective employers otherwise I‚Äôd be trapped at the same bad salary.

To legally force the extra work, they need new contract saying what work is required to get your pay. You can and should point out new contract with more work and same pay is not beneficial to you and you won‚Äôt sign it. They can keep old contract and get sane work or they can compensate extra for extra work.

,,RagingHardBobber,,,,,"Yeah no. Your age has nothing to do with how much salary you should get. Salary should be calculated out of the range for the *role* you're in. I know plenty of people my age, in my company, that make much more than I do, and I know plenty of people who make less.

Tell them that's unacceptable. You need to be compensated for the new role you'd be taking on.

However, where I differ from a lot of other commenters, if they still refuse to give you a raise, I would *not* pass up the promotion. ""Manager"" is always going to look better on your resume. Take the promotion, wait 6 months, then go out with your refreshed resume that says ""manager"" and get a job that pays what the title is worth."

If you believe that you did not receive a raise because of your age, you may want to speak with your HR representative or a lawyer to discuss your options.

Either way, it‚Äôs not okay, and I‚Äôd be having a chat with my older colleagues like, ‚ÄúHey, did you know they won‚Äôt give me a raise because they don‚Äôt want to give older employees raises?‚Äù

,,elsbeth-,,,,,"When I was in the workforce, the title almost always preceded the raise. What I can also advise, in hindsight, is don't let your salary rise too quickly. As you will be one of the first layoffs when you hit a certain ceiling. After my layoff from a firm with very good benefits, I later wished I had negotiated with them to stay on at a lower salary, or taken a different job with them at lower salary (if such a thing had even been possible). To stay working there would have been worth it. 

I did find jobs after that, and they always paid me more than my salary at the former company had been. But their benefits were nowhere near as good, nor the way they treated employees. You just can't learn some things except in hindsight."

Unless you are in your dream company at the moment and love the job amd team you have with amazing work+life balance THEN, I say take the position and leverage it to a manager position with the correct compensation. In 3 months ask for the correct compensation and a bonus making up the difference pay you should have received.

Otherwise, I'd suggest let them know that you are glad they thought of you but that you'll turn down the promotion and continue with your present duties and compensation package because taking on additional responsibility with commensurate compensation is not acceptable. In that last case also polish up your resume and start looking because they will begin to retaliate with shit like ""not a team player"" and you'll find your current job/duties/treatment changing and becoming less desirable."

Your age is irrelevant here. Rather than arguing the age issue I suggest putting in a salary/raise request as a condition of accepting the position and declining if they are unwilling to give you a raise.

,,Severe-Drink2256,,,,,"Honestly, I would say if the promotion does not come with an increase in salary commensurate with my new responsibilities then I am happy staying where I am. (I am sorry - your company is ridiculous for saying that you can't make more than others your same age who don't have the same responsibilities. That is just stupid.)"
,,Tan-Squirrel,,,,,I would leave immediately or not accept the new role.
,,SabinedeJarny,,,,,Tell them to hire someone they feel warrants beings paid what the position is actually worth since they‚Äôre trying to milk you for all it‚Äôs worth. Put your foot down now or this will become a pattern for you with that company.
,,CaraParan,,,,,"Keep the position, and learn the knowledge it lends. Then look for a new job."
,,whatsrawdawg,,,,,"being young in the corporate world usually results in getting the shit end of the stick, at least from my experience.

at the end of it all, even if it's just in title, this promotion is guaranteed to translate to bigger bucks down the road, just not at your current gig.

only consider fighting for a raise if you work in a field where finding a job is trivial. otherwise choose your battles wisely."
,,MJ50inMD,,,,,"The smart play is to take the job and develop the skills for it over the next couple of years, then you'll find it much easier to achieve a very large raise moving to another company with demonstrable accomplishment.  

Creating a lawsuit turns this wonderful opportunity into a shitshow.  Its astonishing to me how many people will ruin their career because their first instinct in any circumstance is to scream lawsuit.  Although I'd guess most of the people who advise so will never have much of a career to ruin."
,,disheartenedagent,,,,,Find a new company. This one is showing a giant red flag.
,,Mishtayan,,,,,"Doing more work isn't a promotion unless there is more money. They are taking advantage of you.

Will the 'promotion' look good on a resume? Will the new job skills help you land a better job in the future? Those are reasons for agreeing, but you should begin looking for a better company to work for."
,,Intelligent-Disk526,,,,,"My take on this is that your employer is trying to pull one over on you. You should never, NEVER, take on more responsibility without an balanced increase in pay/benefits. Pay should not be based on age, but on the job description. If they think that you can adequetly fullfill the job duties then they need to compensate your accordingly. Simple as that. I'd turn down the role and start looking for a more ethical employer."
,,Last-Winner9396,,,,,"You definitely should fight for a raise.  Not based on age but based on the promotion and the added responsibilities you will be taking on.  Ask to see your personnel file.  This will help you point out all your positive aspects. For example, if you have exceptional attendance.  If you can prove age, that is why you are not getting a raise and can prove it to talk to a lawyer."
,,Silygyrl,,,,,"A lot of companies have salary ranges. HR/Comp can be restricted on how much they can pay for a position; usually someone can fall within 80-120% of market value and based on company structure. It's possible you've hit the max for your level and they cannot promote you to the next level or maybe there isnt one. However companies often have ways around base salary limits. They may offer an adjusted bonus, long term or short term incentives, restricted stock options, etc. My guess is the employee who informed you it was due to your age was highly misinformed or making up excuses. It's likely due to your job level and company structure not your age. If you have evidence it is due to your age, in writing, talk to a lawyer."
,,wtf_mike,,,,,"Unfortunately, the latter is true. In the US, age discrimination only applies to those over 40 when the discrimination occurs for being old."
,,chathobark_,,,,,Yeah there‚Äôs no such thing as reverse age discrimination unfortunately
,,Bullen-Noxen,,,,,"The problem is, I doubt op has the key words down in writing, either text or email or via official employee papers."
,,DogyKnees,,,,,Don't waste your time on lawsuits.  Put the new title on your resume and shop the market.
,,1re_endacted1,,,,,"It‚Äôs not. Anything under 40 does not fall under the ‚Äúprotected class‚Äù for age discrimination. Discrimination is only against anyone in a protected class and each protected class has well defined perimeters. 

For example, my SO left a company we both worked for and I was retaliated against with increased scrutiny and changing my assigned duties literally the next day. 

Technically it‚Äôs not considered retaliation bc it was not a result of me committing a protected activity like complaining to HR about discrimination or being a whistle blower on someone else‚Äôs behalf. 

It‚Äôs dumb."
,,Arakk01,,,,,"Age discrimination legally only exists in America for people over 40. Before that, minors are all but considered private property of parents. People in their twenties are culturally regarded as having barely gained personhood and pushing their luck by asking for more, primarily because the culture of American government is almost exclusively that of the 40+ age demographic."
,,Devrij68,,,,,"Yeah it's actually age discrimination. They're saying they won't pay you more because if your age, not because of your experience, and that is absolutely not okay."
,,youngmcdonald85,,,,,Yup my firm gives out new titles in between review season to assuage egos. Some of even make up fancy titles for the hell of it. Always funny to watch new people chase those instead of more personal earning power.
,,IsCharlieThere,,,,,"It‚Äôs bullshit for sure, but it‚Äôs not necessarily out of greed. Quite possibly it‚Äôs just cowardice and weakness."
,,Bullen-Noxen,,,,,"I actually welcome the honesty. One, it‚Äôs refreshing. Two, you don‚Äôt have to pry to much for the truth. Three, this gives you more to work with than assumptions."
,,cobra7,,,,,One way to do this might be to accept the promotion with a written commitment from management that a raise ( amount specified) will be forthcoming once OP turns 26 or whatever age qualifies him for the raise.
,,luisluix,,,,,"wrong, accept it and then apply for a manager position somewhere else. Easier when you have experience with the title."
,,DTK101,,,,,Lol ppl like this that make it sound so easy. Nbd just say no and go get a new job. Life isn‚Äôt that easy
,,runbcov42,,,,,"Fr, when I was at Home Depot they kept trying to make me get a forklift license. Having the licence means that you're every department's bitch and you have double the work for the same pay. No thanks."

,,wtf_mike,,,,,"Legally speaker, in the US, age discrimination does NOT go both ways https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/centers-offices/civil-rights-center/internal/policies/age-discrimination#:~:text=Under%20the%20ADEA%20it%20is,%2C%20job%20assignments%2C%20and%20training."
,,Commander_Celty,,,,,"Agreed, OP‚Äôs pay should be based on peers i.e. other managers in the same position, rather than age group. But alas, unethical is not illegal so they appear to have the legal right to cite this as a reason for lower pay.

OP my advice would be the writings on the wall, the company has illogical and unethical employment and management practices. Accepting the position will be getting one step closer to that club and the impending pressure they‚Äôll place on you to behave similarly. I‚Äôd leave. 

On the flip side, if you don‚Äôt hate the opportunity, and think they won‚Äôt pressure you to go along with similar unethical practices, then take it and gain the experience. Then, in a year, market yourself to a company that will likely pay you much more and under better conditions. Cheers and good luck, you‚Äôre one of the high performers."
,,dougie_fresh121,,,,,Take the new title and put it out IMMEDIATELY.
,,GPT19,,,,,**YOU Are So Right! That is the answer.**
,,CauseOk5940,,,,,I came here to say this. 100% best answer.
,,tippybunny,,,,,"Military does this shit all the time, gives you a higher position before a higher pay scale can be reached. (Team leader, squad leader, platoon leader, first sergeant, xo, commander) almost all of these assignments are often entrusted a rank earlier.

,,No-Television8759,,,,,...that seems like age discrimination
,,2dGoob,,,,,"You could try and regardless, then claim relief under the 14th amendment - I'm curious to see how that'd go.

Ironically, that law may also be what's stopping them from giving OP a raise too, lest the older employees claim discrimination."

,,NewEcho2940,,,,,Well that sounds like another lawsuit
,,SeansModernLife,,,,,Has this already been tried?  This sounds like obvious discrimination that could make it to higher courts.
,,Bullen-Noxen,,,,,"In a fucked up sort of way, that in itself is discrimination. 

Why is this hard for people to understand? If they deny something to you based on you being young, that‚Äôs ageism."

,,spcmack21,,,,,"Depends on the state. Oregon expanded theirs to 18+, but still no protections for younger teens as Taco Bell or something."

,,amretardmonke,,,,,That is complete horseshit
,,,,,,,Well that sucks! Technically anybody can be discriminated against for their age. I bet women of childbearing years are discriminated against a lot!
,,LogikD,,,,,Theres nothing reverse about it. That‚Äôs like saying racism against whites is reverse racism. It makes no sense.
,,theedevilbynight,,,,,"solvable problem. not OP-specific, but if anyone ever has an oral conversation to follow up on, it‚Äôs always a good idea to, after the conversation, write an email to the person you spoke with. include the details of the conversation as you understand them, and ask the person to confirm that your understanding is either correct or where your understandings differ. it‚Äôs not the same as written communication all the way, but it‚Äôs still helpful. sometimes myself and the other person are just straight up having two different convos, so it‚Äôs just generally a helpful way to clear up potential misunderstandings before any/many issues arise."
,,Radiant_Pack9464,,,,,Sadly it's not in the US. Age discrimination only applies to those 40 and older here.
,,BurrStreetX,,,,,It‚Äôs not
,,Unlikely-Rock-9647,,,,,It depends.  Long term the new title can lead you to a better job at a new company.  Switching jobs every few years will almost always do better for you financially than staying in your current role and chasing raises.
,,Bullen-Noxen,,,,,Can‚Äôt it be all 3?
,,GPT19,,,,,"One of my techniques I have used in corporate America is you go to your boss and ask has our phone system been compromised or is our company directory of all employees on line somewhere? Why he might ask. In any case tell him you keep getting calls over the last few weeks from head hunters, and to be frank it is quite annoying to you. Ask your boss, can anything be done to stop these unsolicited calls. He may ask where are they from. Your answer,  I do not know but every time I answer such a call I tell them I am not interested in changing jobs. At which point they ask about my friends or associates at my job if they might be interested in talking to them, My answer is always the same- no. -Trust me your boss will really start thinking about you in a different way since he knows you are getting solicited."
,,Swift_Scythe,,,,,"THIS. Is the answer. Suck it up OP for say a few months get that title down. 

But always be looking and NOW you have MANAGER as former position."

,,EqualLong143,,,,,Having a manager title for a tiny amount of time isnt going to get you anything. Especially when you immediately to to ditch the company that promoted you. Best to decline citing the lack of raise.
,,MidwesternBWCbull,,,,,"OP, listen to luisluix! You don‚Äôt want your boss or coworkers from holding you back. Huge green flag if someone has on their resume a recent promotion within the same company. Including context in your cover letter that even though you‚Äôve taken a massive increase of responsibilities, you‚Äôve simply outgrown your company as they can‚Äôt compensate you more $ bc you‚Äôre still so young, mention how this motivates you to become more successful in future endeavors.

,,peachbeb,,,,,"It could depend on the company though. If HR doesn‚Äôt know about what‚Äôs going on, they might actually not be okay with this because it‚Äôs against some sort of values the company has. Like if they want a completely equal workspace. 

I also worked for the state in the court system and there was age discrimination in the work place from older people to younger people and it was very prohibited. Once higher ups found out, they fired the person that said the worst statements. I never found out if it was legal reasons or their own company policies."

They will lay any BS on you. Im at the point now where im just looking for a new job. Basically got told that in the best engineer they have but they cant pay me.more than some old fart thats been there 30 years.

,,mimprocesstech,,,,,Almost like it was planned.
,,MrBlack-Man,,,,,"It is. Yet, it‚Äôs legal."
,,Avocad0_Lov3r,,,,,Not all discrimination is illegal. This is a case of legal discrimination. It could (and should) be changed with a new law but I don't really see it happening tbh.
,,shroomsAndWrstershir,,,,,"Ageism for being too young is simply not illegal.

You can't drive until you're 16, even if you're 6' at 14yo. You can't get a work permit in some places until you're 14. You have to go to school until you're 18 or graduate. You can't supervise someone on a driver's permit until you're 25. You can't buy cigarettes until you're 18.

There are entire neighborhood communities that you can't live in unless you're 55+.

Then there are the constitutionally-explicit ageist restrictions like voting, drinking, and being elected to Congress."

,,Bullen-Noxen,,,,,What stops a toxic person from not replying & later on claiming the recounts of the conversation were different?
,,Devrij68,,,,,That's some serious bullshit. Here you can't even advertise a job asking for x number of years of experience because it's age discrimination against young people who may have the necessary skills without having to do the job for 10 years.

That said, I do think you should push to increase the pay. Why wouldn‚Äôt they? Make it your own but the general vibe I‚Äôd take is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be making way more than others my age? Fine, are any others around my age in this role? How would my comp compare to others in this role regardless of age? If I‚Äôve overachieved for my age to get here early, why would I be compared and paid like others my age that haven‚Äôt?

Do you think it really takes 10 years of on the job experience to be a decent butcher? This was for a local shop too, not some high end situation.

It's better to just ask for the skills you need rather than assuming an arbitrary amount of time will grant them by default."
,,Green_Heron_,,,,,Yeah. I agree with others advising to take the promotion in title and leverage it to get the corresponding pay increase at another company.

People without 10 years will still apply, and will be better off knowing what the employer is looking for.

No job I‚Äôve ever applied for has been one where I have fit every single requirement. This is normal.

,,cowghost,,,,,I guess i was wrong. I swear its changed tho. I distinctly rember it being 1986 about 7 years ago.
,,wirelesstkd,,,,,"Yes. It IS discrimination. Lots of discrimination is legal. There no law saying discrimination, broadly, is illegal."

,,iamcoding,,,,,"Too bad I live in the USA and don't get guaranteed paid vacations or livable wages, or I'd be happy to travel and relieve myself of this ignorance."
,,Devrij68,,,,,"I think you misunderstand me. I'm saying that instead of saying ""you must have x amount of experience"", which actually doesn't tell you what they want you to be able to do, I would encourage those recruiters to be less lazy and actually think about what they want their ideal candidate to be able to do and list those skills.

It's less about ""I'm sure th candidate I want will apply even if they don't meet my arbitrary requirement"" and more about attracting candidates that meet your business needs.

It's not rocket science dude."
,,Allboutdadoge,,,,,A judge or courts power is no different when ruling on constitutional matter. Nonetheless all law is rooted in a constitutional context. To say it is not relevant is silly.
,,MarcusAurelius68,,,,,If that were the case then Gen X would be from ~1964-1986 which is 22 years‚Ä¶
,,Appropriate-Food1757,,,,,Well you said just about which implies a majority. There are maybe 10-20 on the list
,,GuyNoirPI,,,,,It isn‚Äôt a constitutional matter my dude.
,,tropicaldiver,,,,,"My guess, not an attorney?  Nor a non-attorney  steeped in labor law?  I know something about the subject but by no means am I am expert.

The ADEA in 1967 defined the class as over 40.  Literally doesn‚Äôt apply.  The Equal Pay act doesn‚Äôt apply.  There isn‚Äôt a common law basis I am aware of.

There is no constitutional matter here unless you are trying to make an equal protection claim under the 14th.    

Yes, there can be state and local rules that might go further although I am aware of zero that would apply in this instance.  And I would be reluctant to advise a younger employee to go the complaint/litigation route for all sorts of reasons apart from the strength of their case."
,,cowghost,,,,,I thought gen x was 76-86
,,iamcoding,,,,,"Fair. But your response also implied that I said any, which isn't true."
,,Allboutdadoge,,,,,"You realize that the constitution is just the law that is established in a different way, right? A judge‚Äôs power regarding the law is the same regarding constitutional issues as well as anything else."
,,MarcusAurelius68,,,,,Not even close.
,,lezzerlee,,,,,Your argument isn‚Äôt backed up by the fact that there are 195 countries and ‚Äújust about any‚Äù implies a majority to nearly all. Arguing against someone pointing out how your statement was too broad is a bit silly.
,,GuyNoirPI,,,,,You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about lol. Constitutional Law is a distinct field of law.
,,Allboutdadoge,,,,,"You say that as if it means anything. A federal judge or court who rules on federal issues has broad authority over the interpretation over the law -whether it is a constitutional matter or not. If it is a state judge or court, they will have the broad authority over the interpretation of state law -whether it is constitutional or not.

[https://www.britannica.com/topic/court-law/Judicial-lawmaking](https://www.britannica.com/topic/court-law/Judicial-lawmaking)"

,,Objective_Regret_421,,,,,"There are pros and cons to every job. 

Have a job you‚Äôre super passionate about and you‚Äôre stressed about doing well and are constantly thinking about work.

Have a job you‚Äôre not really into but pays well and you‚Äôre a slave/feel unfulfilled. 

After working 30+ different jobs since I was 14 years old (38 now), I can confidently say I would much rather feel like a slave. Life is just easier when you have a job you don‚Äôt have to give 100% effort in.

I do look for smart people who have the skills required for the job, even if they have no prior direct experience. I love rocking at my job. It makes me feel good.

I started out at the most basic, entry level position in the company and I‚Äôm now sitting 2 seats down from the President of a large corporation. I always thought that if I got into management, things would be different but actually it‚Äôs just worse. I miss the days of just coming to work and doing my job. Now I have to worry about everyone else doing their own jobs, plus my own, plus playing the political games and staying on the right side of the people that can influence my tenure all while fighting for what is right. 

The stress is a lot heavier now and while the pay is great, I sit and wonder some days wtf am I doing to myself. With all of that said, even thinking about starting over gives me a headache. I don‚Äôt want to interview, I don‚Äôt want to read another company handbook, I don‚Äôt want to learn someone else‚Äôs culture or figure out what their corporate culture game is. Sometimes it‚Äôs just better to stay with the evil that you know. I no longer care about making more money, now I‚Äôm just concerned with making sure I‚Äôm healthy to enjoy the money I have. And by healthy I mean in all ways - mentally, physically and emotionally. Because sometimes this job just takes it all from me."
,,tropicaldiver,,,,,"Short answer:  you are diminishing the word ‚Äúslave.‚Äù

A slave is the owned property of another.  A human being owned by another human being.  Full stop.

Don‚Äôt compare a $200k job you can quit at any moment with being the owned property of another.

You can quit.  You can seek another opportunity.  You are paid.  You are not the property of your employer.

Yes, you can always be fired.  But if you own your business, that can always fail as well.  There are no guarantees in life.  Every job as pros and cons.

Finally, it sounds like you might have an anxiety disorder given some of your comments.  If so, I would encourage you to seek therapy."
,,Legitimate_Western83,,,,,"Especially since your pay deductions cost often increase to such an extent that your net is no better/barely better, and it‚Äôs worth is negative compared to increased cost of living.

I know that wasn't the main point of your post, but when I see people using words like ""slave"" to describe themselves and their experience, I have to call out the inherently racist implications of that.  Are you Black, or a member of another historically oppressed community?  Were you kidnapped from your home, put in chains, and ordered to do back-breaking work from dawn to dusk every day?  Are you regularly beaten for no good reason at all?  Are you doing the work without being paid for it?  I think you get where I'm going with this.  Don't compare yourself to a slave.

,,gilbertwebdude,,,,,"When you work for someone else, you will only earn what they are willing to pay you as their worker or work for yourself, and there are no limits to what you can earn and you control your own destiny."
,,TheAlphaNoob21,,,,,Is starting your own company not on your radar at all?
,,JSutt771,,,,,">The fact that your not in control and you can be fired for anything at any moment doesnt really feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù

If a business or manager is doing this, firing people just because, then you don't want to work there anyway.  Having a revolving door is not a good business model.  I know there are places that do that, and that's how we know it's not a good business model, because those places are absolutely terrible.

>Secondly the idea of interviewing is daunting. It has nothing to do with how good you could be at the job its all about how good you are at actually interviewing.

100%.  It's a conversation.  What kind of person are you?  How well will you fit with the team?  If they just wanted to know a skill set, they could get that off your resume.

And do I feel like a slave?  Well...I get paid, so no.  I'm able to call in sick or take a day to go to the doctor, so no.  I'm able to take vacation time and go on a trip, so no.  A slave wouldn't be able to do any of those things.  They'd be chained up at the place of work, would probably be lucky to get a bathroom break, would be working 16 hours a day, maybe get one meal, and they'd only go to the doctor if they were dying.

So no.  We're not slaves.  Stop being dramatic."

The short short version is, kinda. Capitalism is shit to the working class, and I would avoid terms like ""slave"" because that shit's not behind us.

I also don't have to worry about finding clients for the company, hiring people, etc, etc. Even if I went solo, I now have to handle 100% of all company operations. Fuck that I want to do security engineering stuff. When I feel like I'm not being paid fairly I itemize things that I've done that warrant the raise and talk to my boss/hr. If I don't get it I start looking for work elsewhere. Which is also a huge benefit. I can just go do something else tomorrow and not have to worry about paying off the last company or moving things, I just walk out the door.

I don't know what line of work you're in, but even though most work is ""at will"", I don't feel that people can be fired, ""for anything at any moment"".  There's usually, hopefully, some underlying cause.

I do this part of my day to pay for the next part of my day and support my family and they don‚Äôt cross each other. Work and Home are ALWAYS 2 separate things. That, I believe, is why I don‚Äôt ever feel like a slave to my job."
,,Lions212,,,,,I think if you make 200+ and don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù then maybe something else is up?

,,HelixViewer,,,,,"Greetings friend

I am concerned that you have high expectations regarding work.  Your expectation of being in control is counter to not owning the company.  You are there to be of value to the company not to control it.

Many roles within a company require that you meet people and make a good impression for the company, quickly.  A good showing at the interview provides some information as to how well you do under those conditions.  It is not irrelevant to your job if you have advancement in mind.

I am an introvert.  I use to go in to work at 4:00 am just to work for 3 to 4 hours without having to speak to anyone.  I decided that I would have to do better.  I stopped avoiding people and volunteered for management roles.  As a manager I found myself meeting a new person almost every day.  I got use to this.  Then I started public speaking because it made it easer for me to meet people in a nonwork environment.

If you plan to grow as a person and move up in your company, consider changing yourself to fit the needs of the company.  It will not be ""safe"".  Fear of rejection is ever present."

,,IloveBarryBonds,,,,,"I work commission only sales. Some years I make 100k, some I make 60k and  some I make 80k. I work about 25-35 hours per week. I could walk in and take a dump on my bosses desk and he would say thanks. Why, because the turnover is about 95%. The manager turnover is also ridiculous. I wind up having to train the managers also after they are done with their ""corporate"" training. I hate my job because of all the corporate bs but I love what I do and the freedom. Some days I don't leave the house and some days I might go shopping all day. I can't imagine clocking in and out or being stuck in an office all day."
,,No-Drop2538,,,,,I was in a similar situation. So afraid to interview I bought a company. Still not sure it was the right choice. Employees suck. If I had worked for a better company probably would have kept to the employee role. But checked off box owned company.

,,SweetCosmicPope,,,,,"""Slave"" is probably a bit strong, but I get what you're saying.

I hope to one day transition in to small-business ownership myself.  It isn't the work, you see, that puts me off of being an employee.  It's that so much of my own success is out of my control.  You can be laid off, or fired.  You can do everything perfectly and still be passed up for promotions and raises due to outside influences.  In a perfect world, you would have well-defined goals and rewards for achieving them, but even when there are KPIs, there's still alot of guess-work and chance at play.

At least as a business-owner, you have control of everything that happens with your business and can lead yourself to success.  And yes, there are factors out of your control there, too, but at the end of the day it's up to you how to navigate any issues and bring yourself to success."

It's all a sham. We're all free labor and get the temporary monthly privilege of *not dying homeless* if we work ourselves to death from 18-80"

,,CringeGamesMod,,,,,"Welcome to capitalism. Where everyone believes they are a capitalist because they live in a capitalist country. You ask your average American what capitalism is, and they'll describe commerce to you because schools failed them. In the end, the ""American Dream"" is capital ownership (as it always was), and private property is where most people in America own capital. As we get more investment banks buying up houses and ""investors"" buying starter homes to rent them as Air-BnB's... that's what actually takes away from the next generation's future, not deficits. And there's nothing you or I can do about it. There's nothing that any individual can do about it, because you can't change the world with consumer activism. You need someone who is willing to fight billionaires and make them suffer at a government level, and without that, we're just going to keep talking about how it sucks to be exploited by poorly run companies."

I wake up at 5:30 am, drive an hour to work, then work between 8 hours to 10 hours a day, then drive an hour back to home. With an hour lunch break included, That's at least 11 hours tied to work.  I get home between 6 pm and 7 pm, and I only have 2 hours to myself before I go to sleep. 

I do make 80k a year, but I'm at a point where I valve my time more than money."
,,kickinwing-,,,,,"No, never. I chose to work instead of being homeless or getting government assistance. I work and earn a wage. I've worked crappy jobs but I skilled up and moved on from that.

,,CodaDev,,,,,"One thing my father told me when I was young, is you‚Äôre never the one in charge. Even a business owner reports to someone.

This is very true, I‚Äôve been a business owner for the better part of 10 years and I‚Äôve never really called the shots on things. It‚Äôs the investors, the state, enforcement agencies, local media/market, employee retention strategies, etc. Even if you are in charge, you regularly have to do things you don‚Äôt want to and being ‚Äúfired‚Äù as the boss with personal assets at stake is a lot more stressful and fear-inducing. You work more hours, work goes with you wherever you go and all times of the day, you never really know if you‚Äôre about to fk something up or not, no clear guidance (but everyone willing to sell you guidance). I only do it because I‚Äôm a work hard play hard kind of guy and it fits my personality. Some weeks I work what feels like 200 hours, other weeks it‚Äôs 5-10 and I‚Äôm just doing things I enjoy like a madman (enjoying the call before the storm)."
,,Glass_Librarian9019,,,,,"I've actually found the opposite as my career has progressed, but it was something I remember worrying a lot about early on. There's two elements to it, in my mind. 

My living expenses are really low relative to my income. 6 months or even a year with no income from wages wouldn't be worrying, so I don't feel as dependent on my employer.

What was a little less expected is how much more confident I feel about my value as an employee. If I don't like how I'm being treated at one job, I can always just get another job. 

I think it's kind of strikingly in contrast to very common advice you see how the importance of passive income. That idea that you need a side gig or small business or to own real estate to be free. I had a side gig for 15 years, owned a small business for 7 and still own some real estate. Frankly I do have some passive income today and that's a part of why I can comfortably go without an income from wages for months.

So it's not black and white, but I definitely feel _more_ security and safety from being somebody who's good at something not many people are good at that big companies need.

It also helps enormously to have hired extensively for people in my field. Hiring is one area where knowing intimately how the sausage is made will only benefit you."
,,jasper_grunion,,,,,"There is an adage that says to get a degree if you want to work for someone else (pay, security) but skip college if you want to be your own boss (high risk, high reward). Personally I went the degree route, and I know what you mean. Still, there‚Äôs another term called lifestyle entrepreneurship which states if you have a stable job that allows you to not have to fret over things, that can increase the quality of your life. I think that‚Äôs also true."
,,Crafty_Mortgage2952,,,,,"um, no. open a history book get a clue"
,,Fixed-gear,,,,,"I‚Äôve always benefited from an interview process. Especially the most challenging ones. Even if it wasn‚Äôt a perfect fit, I often find myself better for the experience. And of course, as the saying goes, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not just interviewing you. You‚Äôre interviewing them‚Äù 

As far as the other feeling goes.. I think that‚Äôs a good sign you‚Äôre in tune with your body. We‚Äôre not born to be cast in these roles and it triggers an unnatural response. Some people can live with it.

Always follow your gut."
,,dannielvee,,,,,"Slave, fuck no. That's rude AF OP.

You don't have to work or do whatever you're doing. You're scared to take a risk and meet your full potential like most of us. I work, not an owner. I felt trapped at one point in my career and eventually realized you can do anything you want in this life. It's all about balance. Maybe you have less cash, but more time and freedom. You just have to choose. Nice car or something else.

Slave. Never ever. Rude AF to compare yourself to a slave working at McDonald's or whatever. 

Step one, get an education about slavery."
,,EvilMorty137,,,,,It‚Äôs a nice little oblivious world when you are an employee. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the company at all especially if it‚Äôs big and you carry no risk or responsibility if the company goes under. You just move on to the next job. Yeah you make less as an employee but that‚Äôs the trade off - if the company fails you aren‚Äôt the one that has to pay off those business loans and other debts
,,bigblued,,,,,"Even with your own business you are dependent on outside forces. Nothing is ever ""safe,"" you just have to choose which risks you want to live with every day.  Sure, I can't be fired, but I can have a 30% reduction in my income due to a drop in online purchasing post pandemic.  Yeah, I never have to ""interview"" again, but I regularly have to communicate with customers and seek out new clients and revenue streams which is basically just lots of mini interviews I do every day.

There is no ""set it and forget it"" in life.  There will always be challenges and things out of your control."
,,ballet-parfait,,,,,Saying u make ‚Äú200+‚Äù and ‚Äúfeel like a slave‚Äù in the same sentence is wild.
,,No_Particular_770,,,,,"I too am tired working for others at their will. If I could do my younger years over, this is one thing I would do. Stop spending money, save save save, invest and invest. If you are single, you should be living on 35k max, save everything else. When you have a million or two, get the heck out of the rat race and do something you would do even if you didn't get paid."
,,Earl_your_friend,,,,,"My boss took a sudden vacation.  His car was ready to be picked up early. He flew to Germany.  Was able to get his car right off the assembly line. Drove around Germany for a week.  Then, he shipped his car back to the States. The person who replaced him was a guy who was removed from my department for dishonesty.  I'm thinking I might not be a slave but I am out in the fields while some live in the big house."
,,DSM20T,,,,,"Yes I feel like a slave working for someone.

 Also having been a small business owner for the last ten years I feel like I'm a slave to my employees and customers.  

So basically just a slave all around. 

Damn the man!"
,,UnintelligentSlime,,,,,"Honestly? No. 

I think your biggest problem might be interviewing. Because I am good at interviewing, I feel like I can leave and find something good whenever I want, and my value as an employee continues to grow. 

I don‚Äôt really enjoy the overhead around interviewing (sending resumes, scheduling, etc) so I‚Äôm not keen to get on the market right now, but as soon as I feel like it‚Äôs time, I‚Äôm very much looking forward to negotiating more pay/benefits/whatever. If I‚Äôm fired for no reason, take some UI and start putting out resumes again.

If you‚Äôre making enough because you have a valuable skill set, none of this should really feel like a trap- it‚Äôs a game and you are the valuable piece.

If none of that resonates with you, maybe you should consider starting your own business. I don‚Äôt like that idea personally because being at the mercy of the market/consumers feels like a more vulnerable position to me. But life itself is a balancing act, you just gotta figure out what angle makes you least uncomfortable."

,,glantzinggurl,,,,,What field are you in and is it something you‚Äôre interested in beyond the salary?
,,WOWSignal1977,,,,,"Not really. I don't live pay check to paycheck, continue to save, no debt, I work at an at will company and likely so do you meaning you can quit whenever you want (slaves cant say eff this I'm out), I have been homeless by choice before so I know that in almost the worst case scenario I'll be okay, I actually hope to get fired sometime so I will have no more excuses to do something else with my life. 

So many people think in the USA we must live a certain way (new car, loans and payments for anything that cost more than $20), but don't understand what a trade cost is. There are different ways of living, I choose to live freely.

A better question may be ""Do you ever feel trapped in a mundane state, particularly with work?"" Slavery is a strong word, and still literally exists to this day in the shadows, it's actually scary stuff."

,,dankeykang4200,,,,,"Yeah, and the more I make the more enslaved I feel. I'm in a job now that is paying me pretty much the most I can reasonably expect in my field/location.   It's like goddamn golden handcuffs man.   When I first started I had this sinking feeling as I realized it would be more difficult than ever before to find a place that would pay me more.

,,roree3,,,,,"Yes I hate it and I can‚Äôt understand how we all still accept this. I wish one day all humans don‚Äôt do anything then companies and governments will realize what they lost and learn to treat us better where we become the ones who demand things from them and not them demand things from us because at the end of the day, we dedicated employees with long working hours and short wage are the ones who have these companies stand on their feet."

Never got to see anybody except my neighbors walking by. 

Most of our meetings are still online, but I get to interact with people in person and was very relieved to return to the office.

Some find that idea to do something productive for someone else to be something less desirable and decide to freelance, but that comes with a lot more baggage than just working.

The middle ground is finding a job you like and do well that you could freelance in if you want to eventually."
,,ExternalManager3027,,,,,How do you find these jobs?
,,Dreadedtrash,,,,,I got really lucky when I found this job.  I didn't take in to account the advantages of employee ownership and honestly probably after a year here still don't understand all of the benefits.  All I can say that if you can work for an employee owned company I absolutely would.  I've got probably another 25 -30 years to work and honestly I might just stay where I am.  We have been around for over 90 years and when the original owner wanted out he sold it to the employees.
,,Dreadedtrash,,,,,"I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I guess back when a bunch of companies were going back to the office our CEO said that we had to be back 5 days a week. I guess the employee-owners said that they didn‚Äôt want to go back so now we are permanently hybrid.  

The other day my boss was taking about a big change that was going to have to happen. He told me that would be my legacy at the company and not his.

I‚Äôm not perfect in that respect, I don‚Äôt think any of us are, but I have survived with little to no income and I‚Äôve suffered or fucked up at high incomes, and I‚Äôve been happy at any level with the right management of my income.

Certainly agree that low wage jobs can lead to  more expensive services, financially and otherwise because you can‚Äôt afford help, or protective insurances, or the mentally healthy peace of mind that comes with ‚Äúokay my bills are paid now let‚Äôs find a place for this extra money, like start a college fund or an emergency fund‚Äù versus ‚ÄúI only have enough for rent and food and my kids are wearing church donation box clothes and eating ramen and Mac and cheese every night‚Äù. That does have the potential to trap you in a cycle of poverty and hardship that feels akin to slavery‚Ä¶ but people who can adapt and survive are not slaves to their employers. Businesses providing services and goods  consumers want, and jobs and money to people who want to work, is not inherently a bad thing. Of course horrible businesses exist, but that‚Äôs not every single last one."
,,Big-Abbreviations-50,,,,,"No. No, it does not. There is nothing about working for pay that is in any way comparable to slavery."
,,tombiowami,,,,,"Uh‚Ä¶.the OP makes 200k.

How far you guys have to go to white wash slavery is wild."

,,TheLollrax,,,,,Politics doesn't have to mean politicians. There are ways to effect change that don't involve electoral processes.
,,efficient_beaver,,,,,"Running a company sounds easy until you try to do it - but I recommend that if you think you can, then give it a go. Doing it, at least for me, showed me how valuable it is to \_not\_ have to deal with every little random thing, and to not have to think about where the next paycheck is coming from, what random customer X thinks, etc. You might appreciate a comfortable 200k+ job a lot more once you try."
,,mesnupps,,,,,It's tough to start your own company and you have to endure a lot of risk.
,,secretsecrets111,,,,,"It is relevant, because plenty of people are making 40-50k living in the most expensive city in the world. And more to the point, if you are making 200k ANYWHERE in the world, you are at least very comfortable. In most places, especially outside the US, you are very wealthy. Sorry but others are right, you're being dramatic."
,,OverallVacation2324,,,,,"Median household income in New York City is 70,000.  I grew up there on 20k per year.  My mom is retired there.  My sister makes 90k per year single mom with two children."
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,"Are you homeless and living in a tent making $200k??? If so, you are your own biggest problem‚Ä¶lmfao"
,,cracker707,,,,,Yeah I knew what you mean. The people who made the most in the professional office where I worked were the ones who had the highest self-confidence and best bs skills. I‚Äôm sure they fooled the hr staff at their interviews into thinking their shit doesn‚Äôt stink. They were really great at delegating to others. Now I‚Äôm I in the building trades and I can say pay is def based way more on what you know.
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,I think it‚Äôs high time you find a good cult to join.
,,tropicaldiver,,,,,Using phrases like slavery to refer to a $200k job you can quit anytime you want:  a) denigrates the impact of those touched by actual slavery; and b) seems whiny.
,,themoirasaurus,,,,,">Are you Black, or a member of another historically oppressed community?

That sentence comes directly from my comment.  So clearly I am aware that not every slave is Black.  I am also well aware that slavery still exists, and that not every slave is beaten and put in chains.  I was trying to keep my comment short, so I made references to the experiences of Black slaves in the U.S. pre-Civil War.  I think that's obvious.  And an additional reason why I referenced the experience of Black slaves in this country was to illustrate why I found it offensive for someone to compare their present-day experience to that of the countless Black people who were enslaved in this country back then."
,,TheAlphaNoob21,,,,,"I think it's less about brainwashing and more about risk. Running your own company is far more risky than having a job at a top company, so it's totally understandable that it's scary. As long as you understand your goals and work towards them, I'm sure you'll do great!"

,,Kurosanti,,,,,"That's the mindset you'll need. Figure out which skills you have to offer, then start offering those directly to businesses.   


You can offer those as recurring services (monthly, yearly) like maintenance, auditing, lawn care, pet care...  


You can offer those on an as-needed basis like repair services (car/computer/machine), haircut/styling, babysitting...

,,shiningwillow,,,,,"While OP definitely is not, minimum wage workers definitely are wage slaves. If you go on Indeed ""wage meets cost of living"" is a special badge on listings. Being forced to live on multiple incomes or suffer from poverty may not be technically slavery, but in the United States where there are enough houses for everyone and no real shortage of necessities, there is no justification for why it's so hard for one person to live alone on an entry level job."

,,ParamedicCareful3840,,,,,You‚Äôre a twit.
,,Big-Abbreviations-50,,,,,"Well, for starters, one difference is that here you are free to leave whenever you choose. If you don‚Äôt like your job, you can interview for another and move. Slaves were not afforded that luxury. 

Another luxury they were not afforded were modern labor laws. Despite their many flaws, we still (where I live, at least) have mandatory meal periods every 5 hours and 10-minute breaks every 2.5 hours, at least 2 weeks per year of paid time off, 3 days of paid sick leave, maternity and paternity leave (may fall under family leave), bereavement leave, on-the-job injury laws, maximum work hour laws, and so on.

Slaves were not afforded ANY of those things. So, despite unfavorable conditions of modern employment ‚Äî which I am not arguing ‚Äî it is not comparable to slavery."
,,tombiowami,,,,,"Op is not asking about m√≠n wage. 
He makes 200k a year and equating slave labor with a job interview."
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,"Or they are completely reckless with money. If you make $200k, you can afford a fucking house even in San Francisco unless you are riddled with massive debt‚Ä¶alas, reckless with money, not due to slave labor. Slave labor is getting paid a wage below the liveable wage"
,,MightyMoosePoop,,,,,Tell that to the middle class engineer in Thailand I met on the train who makes $1 USD a day.
,,tropicaldiver,,,,,"Well, I guess we have found the expert!  /s"
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,Their original post is pretty much one big‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a huge twit flag üòÇ
,,shiningwillow,,,,,"In my comment im not referencing OP I'm referencing your idea that slavery is ""white-washed"". Poverty and wage slavery in America don't discriminate. I don't deny that actual slavery doesn't still exist I am aware it does in many places, I wouldn't compare my situation to actual slavery. However my family and I are definitely pretty stuck where we are at and it would take enormous effort to reach middle class, which then means we lose state insurance and get higher income taxes, pretty much locking us down again. I just believe that if we are gonna need people working at McDonald's and Walmart, they should be able to work those jobs and live securely/not have to live in a multiple income household."
,,Better-Paper-3948,,,,,You should probably read the post OP made again. OP made two different points.
,,RememberOola,,,,,"In a HCOL, $1 million dollars for a condo.  $200k salary cannot qualify for a mortgage unless you make a huge downpayment!"
,,RememberOola,,,,,"I have seen coworkers live in mobile homes, RVs, etc.  They are tech workers!"
,,UzaSnowflake,,,,,That has no relevance to my comment. Thailand is a third world country - I‚Äôm talking about NYC
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,Lmfao. So you‚Äôre telling me that making $200k in SF is the same as making $20k in Denver?? Lmfao
,,EducationNo9434,,,,,"Oh. The horror. And if you‚Äôre living in an RV and actually are a high paid tech worker that is in demand, why the fuck would you live there? That‚Äôs a fucking choice.

Cry me a fucking river or else you know you‚Äôre actually not worth $200k but actually $20k everywhere else (aka‚Ä¶a dishwasher)"

It is very possible, and I'm rooting for you."
,,Tarnarmour,,,,,"If you have a way to support yourself while going to school, it's totally possible. But I'd probably not do it if the only goal is to get a higher paying job; there's plenty of people with Bachelor degrees who *don't* have good pay. Personally though, if you feel there's a major that you'd really like to become an expert in, I think there's almost nothing more satisfying and rewarding than learning and I would always encourage people to seek out more education. Just don't do it for purely economic reasons."
,,KatoPlato,,,,,"Graduated in 2003 with a BSc Microbio degree, was a lab rat then manager for few years. In 2016 went back and got BSc Comp Sci, worked off all loans, consumer and educational, car and house.  Started Medical School in 2022, still no debt, but will have to use FAFSA for next year.

I'll be 44 this August, 2023.

,,professorbasket,,,,,"degree is no predictor of anything, gaining one will not increase your chances of getting hired. The new economy is about skills, not theoretical knowledge. When applying for jobs, no one really cares what you studied, they check what you can do and have done, in practice.

Increasingly disconnected from the job market, i would not take that gamble when there are so many vocational education resources available online."
,,EchoDear4640,,,,,Yes it‚Äôs possible but you won‚Äôt be viewed with the same potential as a 23 year old graduating counterpart but it‚Äôs not to say your goals aren‚Äôt achievable by any means you still have 20 years of runway before you are viewed as 0 growth

PS I also had cancer while pursuing my bachelor."

And I can‚Äôt stop there, because it is a liberal arts degree and my goal requires additional schooling past a BA. The ba is just required to study what I actually want to work in. I was afraid of ageism for a moment, then I realized how silly it is to label oneself by age when we‚Äôre no where near retirement. Also, the industry im going into places value on older people since they‚Äôre perceived as mature and wise in the field. It is possible to make a change at your age, put in the work and don‚Äôt let just your age dictate your entire personality and outlook."
,,Ksnku,,,,,"Never too late to pursue something else. Just do the math on schooling cost and what the expected salary bump will be. To make an informed decision. Also consider what you might want to do. Liking your job is underrated.

I see lots of people recommending coding bootcamp. That is a very popular choice nowadays, however the job market for software engineers and data scientists is not great right now. There's signs of a bubble getting ready to pop. Mostly because software engineer salaries are extremely high, there's too much supply and not enough demand now. You've seen the big fang layoffs happening already. So just be aware of that and weigh that as you consider which industry you want to pursue."

,,Brennelement,,,,,"It‚Äôs not too late for it to be with shifting to a higher earning career field. But you don‚Äôt necessarily need a full degree to do it. There is a massive shortage of pilots right now and you could do very well going through an accelerated flight training program.

,,generallydisagree,,,,,"absolutely . . . 

I don't think most people really know what they want to do until they're about that age or even later.

35 is young, if it's a career you love, you'll be working til you're 70+ (if you want to).

just do it!

You'll always regret it if you don't and always wonder what if you had - that's never a good position to be in.

Ageism in the workplace? People in their 40s are considered to be in their career primes - no enough how to work and what needs to be known.

Mental decline? you said 35 right? I didn't read that wrong, you're not really 85, right? FYI, my Dad is 90 and sharp as a tack."
,,daedalus-7,,,,,"Yes, it just really depends on the job/degree and location I think. I went from 20k/yr bad service jobs to 40k w/benefits by getting an associates degree in CAD when I was 38 and doing BIM modeling for a structural engineering firm. It's ten years later and I make over 85k and can call this a career. I don't think that's a normal path or outcome for most people, but if you find a fit it is definitely possible."
,,Queen_Serenity_I,,,,,"I remember corporate customer facing positions, including receptionist positions, started requiring masters degrees and a second language in San Francisco around 2008 - 2009 and still paid about $15 an hour.

,,Raisin6436,,,,,"The right thing to do is not get into debt not matter what. I would keep the job you have now and get your bachelors little by little. Do it for the love of knowledge. The American Dream is just a mirage. Someone with a bachelors is always better than someone without. There are exceptions like nursing, software engineering, etc but even in those fields you will find people with broken dreams."
,,curiousandnosycat,,,,,"Just make sure your finances are good.any take student loans believing they will certainly get a job. I hope you do, but just be prepared for worst-case scenario.

,,tangylittleblueberry,,,,,Yes. I got my MBA and transitioned out of retail management in my early 30s. I had to take a slight pay cut in an entry level position but within five years was making six figures (nearly double my retail salary).
,,singnadine,,,,,Yes!
,,Steve-O7777,,,,,"Yes, you definitely can.  It‚Äôs just that your window for error is much smaller.  Really think about what career you want to pursue and how to go about it prior to taking the plunge.  

Healthy diet and regular exercise can help slow/prevent any mental decline.  As can just the act of learning something new.

Age discrimination is real, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find a job.  Especially if you‚Äôre career focused and don‚Äôt mess around.  I started my professional career at 38 (I was in restaurant management prior to that) and at our initial corporate training class there were many, many people fleeing the service industry, just like myself.

Also, be careful of how much debt you take on.  You won‚Äôt have as much time to pay it off prior to retirement that a 22 year old might have.  If you go into a field that pays well though it can definitely still be worth it.

Also, my brother in law teaches electricians for a community college.  2 year degree + internship.  They make $$$.  He has a hard time finding students because you need to be fairly smart, but people who are smart/motivated enough to become an electrician typically go to college.  Just something to consider."
,,Johnclark77,,,,,"I was working in my original career (skilled but very narrow field) for 18 years  before I had to change. At 40ys old, I decided to do college, mostly for self improvement/ enrichment, maybe try to move from operations to administration one day. I was taking advantage of my company's tuition reimbursement plan which was really helpful.

A year later, it was announced they would be closing our facility over a period of time, with the final milestone three-ish years away. My only options were to move 1000 miles out of state to another facility for less pay, or resign at the end and find a new career path.

So, here I am, two years after that last milestone, in a new job and moving forward. While I didn't start my degree path with a change in careers in mind, once the closing was announced, I definitely used my academic endeavors to help prepare for the change.

If you can get any assistance for tuition, and manage the schedule balance between work, family, and school, do it. College isn't for everyone, nor necessary for every job, but if you can have that in your back pocket, it can't hurt."
,,KindSplit8917,,,,,"I decided school was bullshit in my first semester. (For me!) I‚Äôm a superintendent building labs now. Make over 150k per year, no debt. Nickname is Dexter."

My life overall is much more fulfilling. I graduated with a guy who was nearly 60. Age isn't a reason not to move forward, I'd even go so far to say it is a reason you should."
,,MostPoetry,,,,,"As corny as it sounds. It‚Äôs never too late to start making a change in your life and start choosing a different path.

,,edlphoto,,,,,"BS IN CIS at 37 MS in Cybersecurity at 45. I'll get my PhD or EdD when I have the energy to deal with writing all those papers. 

I recommend WGU. I earned my MS with them at my own pace. About $4k per semester. 

Degrees are resume padders. I recommend networking with people. Who I know and the way I am able to earn people's respect have gotten me more jobs than my degrees. People skills are so important."
,,Lower-Calligrapher98,,,,,"My dad started law school at 40, and had a 17 year career with one of the best law firms in town and made partner (which, I'm given to understand is more difficult these days).

,,HvnlyDaz3,,,,,Never too late for self improvement.
,,Inevitable_Professor,,,,,"Yes. I was just like you. Around age 40, I found myself unable to grow in my then current role. Ended up enrolling in SNHU. Finished a degree in accounting and finance, and three years after graduating, I making twice what I was at the old job."

,,Consistent-Depth-851,,,,,"My mom went to law school at like 42 or so. She‚Äôs 56 now and has a thriving practice that she loves, plus makes good money. I will say in full disclosure though that she was a PM at a Fortune 500 before that and was already making decent money so she didn‚Äôt have to deal with hardly any student debt."
,,Reasonable_Worry_385,,,,,yes
,,ARedditor_HasNoName,,,,,"I got my Associates when I was 31, Bachelors when I was 34 and my Masters when I was 36. I‚Äôm 38 now and still considering a Ph.D.

,,danghunk312,,,,,I was making around $100k a year at a chemical plant  from ages 25-30. The money was obviously great but I absolutely hated the industry because of work life balance problems (you‚Äôre literally always working 12-16 shifts almost everyday due to mandatory overtime. Weekends and holidays are never guaranteed either) so I quit last year to spend more time with my family and started my own small business doing what I love. And it‚Äôs been so much less stressful and I get to enjoy raising my kids now. Go into a field that genuinely interests you. You won‚Äôt regret it!
,,cureforhiccupsat4am,,,,,"Yes! Yes! Yes!

My wife just started taking the prerequisites courses prior to applying to med school. We are in our late 30s.

,,ShakeandBaked161,,,,,Just went to university and graduated at 23 but the 3 people I hung out with most were between 30-40.  You absolutely can do this.
,,zodwallopp,,,,,There is no highway where we are all on the same career track at the same time. You can go back to school whenever you want and do whatever you want. This whole career thing is something we made up to pass the time between birth and death.
,,evilzug2000,,,,,"Do you have any specific degrees or fields you are interested in? It‚Äôs definitely doable. 

I‚Äôm 40 now, and just pivoted from restaurants to an office job after doing a 2yr program at the local community college. I will say the degree isn‚Äôt even that important, or in my case it wasn‚Äôt. The school always collected job opportunities from area businesses, and got my interview that way before I was even finished. 

Seems a lot of places just want reliable and competent, at least in the lower rungs of the ladder."

 Lift your balls up and do it."
,,Izzoh,,,,,"I dropped out of school at 21, a couple of years into a french literature degree. Got a job fixing construction equipment.

At 35 I went back and endedup with 2 degrees 21 year old me would never have believed I'd be interested in, much less able to finish - math and economics. I had never done any math beyond algebra and that had been 18 years earlier.  Now I'm in my mid 40s with a decent job in tech and I mentor people trying to transition into tech. Considering doing a master's

When I went back, at first I was super self conscious about the whole thing, especially when I was older than some of my professors, but there was a 60 year old dude in my first physics class who really turned it around for me. 

We all figure our stuff out at different times - just figure out what's right for you and do your best to make it happen. Then do your best to help other people make it happen for themselves."

At around age 40. Only needed a few general credits due to her other degree, but then finish nursing program and straight to masters to be an NP. And she loves it. So nah, not too late."
,,DrXenoZillaTrek,,,,,"Started college at 49. (Spent 30 years pursuing a music career) Got my teaching degree at 54, 62 now with a healthy career and building a decent retirement in 10 years or so. So, yes, go for it."

,,dianalucifera7,,,,,"I appreciate all the positive responses on this thread. I had to hold off continuing my education because I raised my 2 children alone..Finally went back to college in 2019 for an AD in Psych(my goal was to be a therapist) 
Before 2019, I worked as a licensed massage therapist since 2006
Then COVID and quarantine happened when I was 2/3 done...had to stop because of mental health issues..
Now I'm gonna be 50 this year and considering my next move...someone suggested tech but the idea of being hunched over a computer coding all day isn't suited for me...
If I stay in Psych then I can't actually practice until I have a Masters..
Also considered law as well...
Can't get away from those helping professions smh...
I do agree that it's only ""too late"" when you're 6 feet under...
Best of luck to myself and everyone figuring out their next move."
,,Derkastan77,,,,,"I was friends with a guy, years ago, who was an engineer. Then, in his mid 30‚Äôs, decided it was what his parents wanted, not whst he wanted. So, he went back to school to become a physical therapist. Had to start from thr ground up. A couple years of all the keniseology undergrad stuff, then get accepted to a PT graduate school program, then 3 years of graduate school. Started out as a PT at 40"
,,MrLionGuy,,,,,"I did. 


Career as a cop. Marry late have kids... Things happen that make me appreciate the miracle that is my family and hate the profession I am in.


Languish in private security and handle school at night to finish the last 18 hours or so of school. 


COVID. Give up on finding anything with my shiny new degree. Kicking myself over money wasted. Money lost. Egotism. Just furious.


Lucky break. Good interview. Now a low level executive in a state agency killing it. Home every weekend. Home every night. Not rich, but I married well, I am making money and building a second pension and my kids college funds while living in a nice part of town and fixing up my house.


Is it perfect? No. Was it easy? Hell no. I kept working and put myself on a place where I could get lucky. I am not special. You can do it too.


I will be 48 next birthday. Degree attained at age 44. 


Just know that it will likely suck. There will be work. There will be sacrifice. It might not work out. If you are unwilling to embrace the suck and the uncertainty, then maybe it is not for you."
,,Jaded_Appearance9277,,,,,Absolutely. I went back to school to get my masters degree at 52.
,,Forsaken_Variation53,,,,,I did at 43. Words do not describe how good of a decision it was.
,,kouridge,,,,,"Earned by BA at 25 and had a 70-year-old in my graduating class. He was student who left to enlist and had a full career before deciding it was time to earn the degree. I decided on the spot that I'd never think it was ""too late"" or I was ""too old"" for education.

Earned my Master's degree at 38, and I was not the oldest in my class - some of us were 40s - 50s. While I didn't go into the career for which my graduate degree is intended, the elders did so successfully.

I got a second wind in my existing career and the confidence boost that I got from earning my degree turbo-boosted my performance and salary."
,,bulky_cicada,,,,,"I will be finished with my Bachelor's at 42. I worry about how being a 40-something woman will impact my job prospects, but I also think my age provides a foundation of life and working experience (""soft skills"" and others) that will benefit me in ways 22-year-old me wouldn't have had as a fresh-out-of-college worker."

,,Practical_Apple6323,,,,,"It's never too late! 
I got my bachelors at 34, masters at 40. Switched career paths completely after 22 years in one field."
,,Qphth0,,,,,"I got an associate in my early/mid 20s, not on a traditional college timeline. I got a good job that a lot of people think of as a great career so i stopped pursuing the bachelors when i was around 80/120 credits. I went back at 33 to finish my degree so I could leave that ""great career"" & start something new. I'm a few weeks shy of 35  & about to start a masters program in data science. I finished those 40 credits in under a year, found a new job I enjoy, found time for new hobbies, made a whole new career path, and like I said I'm about to start a new program. 

Life is short, but it is what you make it. If you want a change, make a change. It's not too late for anything. It has to be realistic though. Research the degree you decide on, talk to professionals, find people on reddit or LinkedIn & ask if you can pick their brain."
,,XrayDelta2022,,,,,"Go finish, an AA won‚Äôt do much. And quite frankly if you choose the wrong BA it won‚Äôt either. Do your homework and select the right path. There‚Äôs a million STEM degrees from all over the world trying to find a job right now. So chose wisely."

,,ianmoone1102,,,,,"Of course. My wife started schooling for medical billing and reimbursement at 47 and is now shooting for a bachelor's. She's already landed a job at a local hospital, which is great but also making schooling a lot more difficult. I'm so incredibly proud of her."

,,docevil000,,,,,Started my current career in a technical field at 33. Do it.
,,Grumpy_kitten11,,,,,"Yes! I was 35 when I went back to college, and I honestly felt ‚Äútoo old‚Äù. For me, my mom was my inspiration. She decided to go to college in her 50‚Äôs, and is now working on her 2nd masters degree in her dream field, at age 62. The time will pass anyways! Go for it!"
,,letsdotacos,,,,,A good friend of mine did it at 38 while preggo with her first kid.  Now she's almost done with a 1 year old.  She is sharp as a tac though.
,,MrsCaptainFail,,,,,"Definitely. When I was 17-21 in college I had classmates that were in their 40s. It was a medical technologist bachelors degree and they went on to do amazing things at high end hospitals. I switched degrees my senior year to molecular biology but we all graduated together and they have great careers, as do i just in public health now."
,,Lil-Baby-Salty,,,,,One of my mentors had no college experience and decided to go to college at 35. He was never great in school but found a specified math he was interested in and enjoyed learning. Ended up becoming a laser engineer at Boeing and retired at 63.
,,steakfarts,,,,,"The answer is yes, especially in your case where you do not have a solid base.

For me, I have tech degrees and a tech career and what would stop me is lost opportunity cost.  If I quit I lose $X, plus the time and risk of getting a degree in another job.  So that stops me, but I am starting from a good place financially that would be hard to mirror.  So the risk factor is too high."
,,ForAfeeNotforfree,,,,,"Yea, the question will be whether the long term payoff is worth the opportunity cost. If yea, go for it."
,,Guilty-Hornet4315,,,,,Not really.

,,FuelAccurate5066,,,,,I got my bachelors in chemistry at 35. I am doing my PhD while working in the semi conductor industry. You are not too old do your thing.
,,rainbowcarnage_uwu,,,,,"Yes. I hadn't been back to school in 8 years. Went back last semester to finish my Bachelor's. It's not harder, actually much easier. Everything is so streamlined, most if not all of my assignments/homework are online. I'm pretty sure covid had a lot to do with that. But yeah comparatively from when I first went to university it's crazy. Even textbooks are digital now. As for the job market, I think a lot of companies are looking and hoping for mature employees. A lot of companies I know are having trouble finding good people. So yeah I think the older employees have become sought after."
,,Alarming_Assistant21,,,,,Nope. You are doomed
,,SparkleUnic0rn,,,,,Absolutely!  My husband and did it at 37.
,,24-8-81,,,,,"No, because the average age of humans is 36. To late."

,,KAEA-12,,,,,"I am beginning all over from criminal Justice to IT certs and web development (could transition into cyber security eventually).
I‚Äôm 37 with a simple business degree.  
Figure out what it is you want to do. Don‚Äôt make any excuses. Take ‚Äúeach step‚Äù getting there. 

Don‚Äôt make unrealistic goals (such as if I decided I would work for Meta, will I apply myself and go straight for it..but realistically finding a starting position anywhere is realistic)

Don‚Äôt be the go so hard because it sounds good burnout. You will likely loose interest going to hard and fail. Whatever it is, take appropriate time (you can still go hard) but know it won‚Äôt just be simple."
,,Crafty-Mountain5377,,,,,In my associates degree there was a gentleman who showed up to our history class everyday who was in his 80s with a cane and later a walker. So I personally don't think it's ever too late to want to accomplish something. It's not too late to start a degrees profession at 35 if you retire at 65 presumably that's a solid 30 years of working ahead of you.   Would you rather do that with something you enjoy or can make money at?

So no, it‚Äôs never too late!  Go for it!"
,,mackbar,,,,,"34 years old...lifetime academic fuckup, spent 5 years squirreling around in JC going because I thought I should. Got called to be minster (Unitarian Universalist) in my mid 20s. Had problems, life happened, global pandemic....after going to community college off and on for nearly 15 years, many of which were years spent taking a break so I could get my life together, I graduated with a 3.0 and got my AA last year. Transferring to UCSD in the fall of this year to get my BA in Religious Studies, then off to seminary for a MA. I'll probably start my professional career when I'm about 40. Most people get ordained as reverend as a second career and start working as clergy later in life so I guess I'm ""on track"" age wise for my field.

Long story short is, yeah man."
,,EdwardJMunson,,,,,Unfortunately the hard limit is 34. Sorry.

Went back to uni and finished my undergrad at 28 yo. It was one of the happiest days of my life...#2, with the birth of my son being #1.  Worked for 20+ years, getting promotions along the way, but saw the limits of how high up the ladder I could go, given my education. At 47 yo, I went to law school and passed the bar at 50.

,,Tarl2323,,,,,"Yes. Harrison Ford did carpenter-> actor at 31.  Ken Jeong did doctor -> comedian at 36.

35 is plenty of time to start a new career. Honestly it's never too late. 

""Too Late"" depends on your level of willpower and energy, and the physicality demands of the career.

Obviously, no you cannot be a firefighter, an FBI agent or several other highly specialized and physical careers that do have timers on them, but otherwise the sky is the limit."
,,harelabbvg,,,,,"Yes, it is definitely possible to start a new degreed career after the age of 35. Many people make significant career changes later in life for various reasons, such as personal fulfillment, new interests, or better job prospects. Here are a few points to consider:  
  
\- Age is not a barrier: While it is true that starting a new career later in life may present some unique challenges, age itself should not be seen as a limitation. With the right motivation, dedication, and effort, you can pursue a new degree and embark on a new career path.  
  
\- Lifelong learning: The concept of lifelong learning is gaining importance in today's rapidly changing job market. Many individuals pursue additional education and acquire new skills throughout their lives to adapt to evolving career demands. Universities and educational institutions often offer flexible programs, online courses, and part-time options that can accommodate adult learners.  
  
\- Transferable skills and experience: Your existing skills and experience can be valuable assets when transitioning to a new career. Even if your previous work was in a different field, there may be transferable skills that can be applied to your desired career path. Analyze your strengths, identify the skills that are transferable, and highlight them in your job applications and interviews.  
  
\- Networking and connections: Building a strong professional network is crucial when changing careers. Leverage your existing connections, join industry-related events, attend workshops, and reach out to professionals in your desired field. Networking can provide insights, mentorship, job opportunities, and potentially help you overcome the challenges of starting a new career later in life.  
  
\- Embrace the learning curve: Starting a new career may involve a learning curve, especially if you are entering a completely different field. Be prepared to invest time and effort in acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills. Seek out opportunities for internships, volunteer work, or entry-level positions that can provide practical experience and help you transition into your new career.  
  
Remember, age should not discourage you from pursuing your aspirations. It's never too late to embark on a new career path and seek personal and professional fulfillment. With determination, adaptability, and a willingness to learn, you can successfully navigate the process of starting a new degreed career after the age of 35."
,,FearCactus,,,,,Yes. I never did university and then did a full bachelors degree in my mid 30s. I‚Äôm now fully qualified and on above average wage in my second job in my new career. Best move I ever made; if nothing else it gave me confidence in myself. Do it.
,,Chico_Bonito617,,,,,Same here man. I got my associates at 30 than my bachelors at 35 and MBA and 37 all at WGU
,,Gabriel_Fono,,,,,"It is not uncommon for people to ask themselves if f they could pursuing their degree when they reach their 30‚Äôs but think about it 
1) spending two to three  years to complete your bachelor will be definitely worth it for your long career 
2) tons of opportunities and remember retirement is around 65 years here in United States , which means if you graduate by 40 , you will still 25 years to work hard and retire good.
It  is worth taking a degree in my opinion"
,,rhkinkoph,,,,,Go for it! I got my master degree at 42 and now working on my PhD at 62. It‚Äôs never too late and you‚Äôre never too old. Best to you!
,,SolarSanta300,,,,,"As a personal milestone I think its a great idea. 

As a late career move? No. Four years of school to balance with your source of income and family/whatever, else is going to be difficult to pull off when you can‚Äôt snort a redbull to replace a full night of sleep 5 nights a week.

Going into significant debt to do it? Helll no. A five (or six) figure loan would give you a very realistic shot at starting a business or investing in something that cashflows. Even a degree that automatically guaranteed you a six figure job would not make financial sense with a second mortgage to offset before you can start to think about getting ahead. Even making six figures you are starting 10-15 years behind to be able to get caught up. 

The sad part is, even if you had the degree completed tomorrow it wouldn‚Äôt guarantee you a higher paying job, or any job for that matter (unless of course the degree is required in a high paying field like engineering, med, law, etc). 

Having a bachelors in a random science or the humanities, or even in business up to an MBA does not get you past an interview for most positions that aren‚Äôt highly specialized (in which case a decade of experience is underlined while the degree is bare minimum)."
,,Dear-Patience2166,,,,,"Do it. I‚Äôm starting medical school at 33 years of age. Most of us feel pressured by a social clock. The truth is that we‚Äôre all on our own, unique journey."

Most of my Male Colleagues left the field they hated it so much. As an RN you are an absolute afterthought by the health system.

After that, I continued along my career path. Now I attend Thomas Edison State University to finish my Bachelors. I still work as an Electronics Technician. I do everything you described in your post and more and get paid well for it."
,,sterrecat,,,,,"It‚Äôs been fairly simple. Luckily my employer wants and supports my training. So I get my clinical competency component done at work. I‚Äôve been at it for six months and I am close to done. Tell your partner to talk up MRI training when interviewing to feel out what a potential employer will support. Some want CT techs more than MRI, so if they don‚Äôt want to do CT they will need to be careful in choosing an employer/job offer. 
There is an MRI tech shortage in many places so they should be able to find places willing to support training. Be cautious of offers contingent on contract and consider them carefully. (I was offered a 2 year training contract but if I failed or left before 2 years I would owe employer $8k, when locally I could do the community college MRI course for $1500, so not a fair trade off. )"

,,professorbasket,,,,,"Yeh totally, the more marketable skill oriented the better."
,,professorbasket,,,,,"Thinking you need a degree for anything that isn't 'professional' like being a doctor, or things that require hard certification, like building a bridge, is 90s thinking. A career hasn't existed for a long time. That rly isn't a thing any more, speaking from working in a field for over 25yrs.

You have to constantly reinvent yourself and change, there's no doing the same thing and certainly not at the same company.

People lose sight that education is a means to an end, the goal is making money with something you learned there, ideally something you don't hate, ideally something that doesnt drain your energy.

It's so sad to see people being sold an idea that you can just study whatever you feel like and then figure out later what you'll do for a job, and if its even applicable.

Like there are ppl that have sunk massive amounts of student loans into degrees that are guaranteed to not have an ROI. Soft studies with no real world application other than teaching it to others. 

I said vocational as its typically more oriented on a specific vocation and is more outcome oriented. but all organized education in traditional form is out of date and many don't connect with what the demand is in the marketplace. At an accelerated rate our world is changing and more and more, the planning and design of teachings years or even decades ago, have no connection to what is needed today.

You don't need anyone's permission to learn things, there's also no gatekeeping information anymore, the main value that these institutions provide if any is the collation and curation of a bundle of info, to save you time. the older educational programs will have the most dusty and less applicable info, and bootcamps would be much more targeted on practical skills that are currently needed. 

With AI hitting the scene, everything, i mean, everything is up for evaluation. If there were no guarantees before, NO ONE knows how this will all play out. One thing is certain, its going to change everything."

,,UnfairRough73,,,,,"Y ray techs is like a foot in the door into that department but the real money is MRI/CT. You can even try and look for a Radiologist Assistant position which requires just CPR certification, all you do is take patients in and out of MRI/CT scans."
,,sterrecat,,,,,"You need your X-ray tech license from the ARRT generally to do MRI or CT. There are some programs that skip the X-ray part but employers aren‚Äôt fond of that path and prefer ARRT certification because they can use you as a back up tech in other areas. 
Lots of people start out with hospital jobs like transporter or reception and job shadow and find out they want to do it. So that might be something to try"
,,Past-File3933,,,,,"Depending on where you live, some hospitals have x-ray tech programs that will hire you after you are done. There are tech schools specifically for this. Just look around online and find a school that will train you for the field. Just have to find a decent school."
,,sterrecat,,,,,"My wrecked back and tired knees and feet have made this the more appealing option. I like X-ray, mentally, but the physical part is just not tenable long term as I age. I can‚Äôt imagine doing all the work of X-ray at 60+.
I should add, there is generally desk work to be done while scanning if you work out patient. I won‚Äôt be just listening to the magnet banging away all day."
,,sterrecat,,,,,"The process to become an X-ray tech at most community colleges is 2 years. There is a large number of clinical hours you need to get ARRT certified for X-ray. After you do that, the MRI is able to be done without formal schooling if you work somewhere willing to train. (Mostly hospitals)
The drawback is that many places will put priority on making techs start with CT not MRI. There is a program where you can skip the X-ray 
 part, but that training is slightly less desirable for employers because then techs can‚Äôt be used as temp help in other areas when they are short staffed. Lots of places prefer techs with multiple certifications. 
Now if you are interested in engineering at all you might be able to do MRI only and then slide into being a service rep, or apps trainer who trains techs on new machines."
,,PixelatedpulsarOG,,,,,Whoa! Are you comfortable sharing which one? This sounds like something I‚Äôd love to do
,,duuudewhat,,,,,Did you have to have any specific knowledge going in? Math and stuff?

,,starfisherwoman,,,,,So cool
,,ClearSecretary2275,,,,,"Yeah, it is a big wall for college graduates nowadays. Forget about we have millions graduates each year. College degrees are not a song we used to sing anymore."
,,TrickyJesterr,,,,,"If you‚Äôre confident and sales-inclined, you can get a badass technical sales job with *any* 4 year degree. My wife works in robotics and those sales guys make 200k+ with communications degrees (seems they‚Äôre majority college ballers). Medical device sales, etc. 

If you aren‚Äôt good at selling (essentially just talking to people and doing what you say you‚Äôre gonna do) don‚Äôt force it though, it‚Äôs not a place for introverts or people lacking confidence and forcing it would probably be anxiety inducing. 

If you like a challenge it‚Äôs pretty cool though, good pay and constant competition but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a hard job. I love being somewhere new doing something different every day, I‚Äôm just not cut out for office life personally."

,,desserttaco,,,,,"Data structures you learn as you go because you use them but no algorithms. From the places I interviewed at it is rare for them to ask you an algorithmic question for front end devs. I‚Äôm now an interviewer at my company and our front end interview questions are more like mini projects than a traditional algorithm question. ( for example make a simple todo list). Obviously for more senior candidates we ask some engineering design questions and some more challenging coding challenges, but nothing from leetcode or stuff like that."

,,sterrecat,,,,,"No, I mean from the constant being on your feet, lifting and moving patients, moving equipment, bending and squatting. Xray is a very physical job."
,,Past-File3933,,,,,"Eh, yes and no. Your best bet is to find a program at a hospital near you and take their course. A certificate is a certificate. You have to be registered with your state as well. That is what gets you employment."
,,PixelatedpulsarOG,,,,,Thank you!! I truly appreciate the helpful info!
,,IndependenceLittle74,,,,,That‚Äôs..math right? Or maybe I‚Äôm wrong
,,Glitter_moonchild,,,,,"Ooohh good to know I guess I wasn‚Äôt too much aware of that, what about mri/ct is it less physical work?"
,,desserttaco,,,,,Not really. If you‚Äôre interested in learning some algorithms in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand I recommend grokking algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava!
,,sterrecat,,,,,Yes. You will still need to help patients sit up/transfer to the scanner and lift/change parts to MRI scanner but generally less lifting and definitely less walking.
,,Glitter_moonchild,,,,,Ohok so pretty much the same but not as much then..do you anything about mammograms? Is it a lot of work like that too? Or less?

Wrong usage of the term ‚Äúhalf assed‚Äù, I meant low effort not inadequate.

... The workstation was basically designed to be difficult to fix.  I  tried to fix it with gear that I paid for with my own money.  I worked but it was not enough.  My health got massively fucked up by that job.  

I won't ever work for a company in the future where I don't have complete control over my workstation in an office or the ability to work from home where it's set up exactly according to my needs.  My health got so messed up by the series of events that that job lead to that at at this point, I would rather starve to death than go through that again.

,,Eastern-Royal5948,,,,,"Only thing I'd add that I haven't seen (but granted, I haven't read all the comments) is to be honest. Tell them why you're leaving. Our society has become so superficial and afraid of honesty. Withholding truth is just as bad as lying to them, and if you truly wish them well, then your feedback is worth mentioning.

As a business owner, I would want to know why my company's employee retention rate is what it is and how I fare compared to the rest of the industry and its progression.

A simple, ""I love this about this company and the culture, but having been here even just a few days, the seeming lack of opportunity for upward mobility and struggle with up-to-date practices just really doesn't sit well with me. I hate to do this so soon, but I won't be able to stay with the company."" ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Since I was still training, there wasn‚Äôt a reason for me to finish out the week and I left her office, grabbed my things from my desk and left.  Be kind, thankful, and stay classy.

,,,,,,,"Any way you want want tbh. You're not mission critical after two weeks, you could leave during lunch and simply not return if you wanted. If your manager was a nice person to you I would probably just have a talk with him on a Friday afternoon and let him know. Otherwise you have no obligation to give these people any more of your time than is necessary. People in this thread are harping on confrontation and doing what's right. I would counter by saying it's your life and sometimes you just can't be bothered to waste another second of it.

Do what you're comfortable doing, it won't matter anyway. You won't list this job on your resume because it was only two weeks. You aren't hanging anyone out to dry because you aren't even trained yet. You will never work for this company again no matter how nice and formal you are about leaving. It doesn't matter how you leave, that's the simple truth."

Share your ideas with mentors along with your thoughts on either being involved in influencing supported change or walking.  If the culture and your leadership team is strong enough to back you then use all of that to your advantage.  I see that as opportunity more so than with a company that already has what you are comfortable with in place.  Also, always in person and whatever you decide, if you are in the US and I‚Äôm sure many other countries, you will be paid for the time you put in at a prorated rate, no matter the terms of your notice or where it falls in the pay cycle.

,,mahbubosmane,,,,,"Quitting a job after just two weeks can be a difficult and uncomfortable experience, but sometimes it's necessary if you've realized the job isn't a good fit for you. Here are some steps you can take:  
  
**Check your contract:** Make sure you review your employment contract and understand the terms for resignation. Some companies may require you to provide a certain amount of notice or have specific protocols for resigning.  
  
**Schedule a meeting with your supervisor:** It's best to have a face-to-face conversation with your supervisor to inform them of your decision. Explain that you've realized the job isn't a good fit for you and you've decided to resign. Be respectful and professional.  
  
**Offer to help with the transition:** If possible, offer to help with the transition process by completing any outstanding tasks and training your replacement. This will leave a positive impression and make the transition smoother for everyone.  
  
**Write a resignation letter:** Write a formal resignation letter, keeping it brief and professional. You can include your reason for resigning, but it's not necessary.  
  
**Follow up with HR:** Make sure you inform HR of your decision and any necessary paperwork, such as returning any company property.  
  
Remember to be polite and professional throughout the process. It's important to leave on good terms and maintain positive relationships, as you never know when you may cross paths with your former colleagues in the future."

Some companies are able to complete the hiring process quicker then others. It would be irresponsible for an individual to not take a guaranteed pay hoping for something that may never materialize. 

 Bottom line, there is no loyalty or integrity in business.  Employees need to have a similar mindset of their relationship with their employer as an employer has if their employees."

,,FlamingTrollz,,,,,"HR / Talent Management a consultant of 30 years here‚Ä¶

Your professional reputation over the years to come is something to always consider, and is very difficult to rehabilitate. So I always recommend a 50/50 approach. 

Always do what‚Äôs right for YOU, but do it in a a manner no one person can say you do not follow professional and thoughtful deform. A good person. 

So‚Ä¶ If you're thinking about or are resigning from your job after only two weeks, I understand that this may be a difficult decision for you in how to do so. However, it's important to make choices that align with your career goals and overall job satisfaction.

Before you resign, I recommend that you review your employment contract to determine your notice period. Typically, this is between one to two weeks for new employees. If this is the case, you can inform your manager after completing two weeks and still be within the notice period.

If you decide to resign before receiving your salary, you should ask your employer about their final paycheck process to ensure you receive any outstanding wages, benefits, or reimbursements.

When it comes to informing your manager, it's best to do it in person. It‚Äôs thoughtful, respectful, professional and it is kind. They are a person, too. You can request a meeting, express your appreciation for the opportunity, and explain that you've received a better job offer that aligns with your career goals. You can also offer to assist with the transition process and ensure that your work is properly handed over.

Remember, it's important to be professional and respectful when resigning from a job. You never know when you may need a reference or want to return to the company in the future. 

Even if not, you have your reputation. You never know who and when and where former employers and peers will end up. How you treat others is something everyone will consider over time. 

I hope this advice helps, and good luck with your decision!"

,,TheRealBatmanForReal,,,,,It's about having a little integrity.
,,cesaretticar,,,,,"You‚Äôre absolutely right! If you died on a Monday, a job posting will be up by Tuesday @9 am! Distance yourself from the masses, head down and do what needs to be done.

,,MrDinklestein,,,,,"You must feel that every person that works for someone is ""exploited."" You poor child."
,,IVIoon-IVIessiah,,,,,I would tell him in person or on a call. Just be honest lying will make it awkward and weird. Some bosses want 2 weeks notice others will make you quit that day. There's no need to be nervous about anything. The worse he may do is make some rude comments but that doesn't happen most of the time. Have they given you any red flags that they are emotional and reactionary people that are going to blow this up? I feel like you may be making this out to be worse than it is actually going to be. Based on your post they all seem to be experienced senior level people. They've have people come and go before this shouldn't be a huge system shock.
,,JimmySide1013,,,,,"As for quitting the job, I think an email to HR and your supervisor or whomever is fine. Send from a personal account so you have a record. Sounds like you‚Äôve already got your mind made up so contact with those you would consider to be mentors is a courtesy, not asking for advice. Call them before sending the email as a heads up."
,,Bm7465,,,,,"If you‚Äôve met your boss in person a few times, let them know in person. It‚Äôs uncomfortable but helpful in maintaining positive long term relationships.

If you‚Äôve primarily communicated with them over chat/email - that method would suffice imo."

,,deekace,,,,,"I worked at a company that fits that description, and while I am not OP, from my experience a place like that also wouldn‚Äôt be receptive to this. 
 
Stagnant with a lot of people doing the same job for many many years meant that in their eyes a newcomer can‚Äôt possibly have a valid idea until they‚Äôve been there for a significant amount of time. And while a departing employee is an excellent source of valuable feedback, I feel like whatever I would‚Äôve said would be reduced to ‚Äúemployees are just too entitled these days.‚Äù
  
So, yes, nothing wrong with offering this feedback, but sounds like OP wants to minimize engagement here, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the route they are looking for either way."
,,needmoremiles,,,,,Are you really confident that they‚Äôve figured out how the sausage is made after 2 weeks?  Maybe it‚Äôs best they just follow the advice the HR pros suggested above.
,,Kingzjames,,,,,"You just cant satisfy everyone,  Gotta move on"

,,juuuustforfun,,,,,"Oh please, he hasn‚Äôt done anything that shows a lack of integrity. And why do you assume he is the one acting in bad faith and not the company/hiring manager?

,,xboxchick311,,,,,Probably to break it down to a level you'll understand. The common denominator in this is you.
,,dragonrose7,,,,,"Because that‚Äôs how life happens. Especially when you don‚Äôt want it to. It‚Äôs a bad personal policy to lie about something that you absolutely do not need to lie about. But hey, you do you."

You know, keep justifying the ends to fit the means all the time.  Those who chose not to make a habit of lying do not have to keep up with what they said to whom and when.  It does not make either party better or worse than the other. One party has less crap to keep up with is all."
,,RepresentativeDrag14,,,,,Not at all bootlicker.  I just have a healthier understanding of where my employer fits into my life.  Hint: it isn‚Äôt at the top of the priority list.
,,Didgeterdone,,,,,"Ok, that works too!"

,,deekace,,,,,Think we found the OP‚Äôs manager
,,Didgeterdone,,,,,"Did you read the post or just my reply. I do not do corporate. OP does not do their corporate anymore. Both us free to say truth to power. Not trying to one up anyone.

,,TheRealBatmanForReal,,,,,"He wants to quit within 2 weeks, and should have at least done due diligence.

,,RepresentativeDrag14,,,,,So dramatic. Do you even work for a living?
,,karmaismydawgz,,,,,and you think the person who worked there two weeks is the proper source?  lol. just horribly bad advice
,,needmoremiles,,,,,"My point is that perhaps, just perhaps, there is a non-zero possibility that two weeks of employment at a large company may not provide all of the insight into the workings of that company that the two week employee thinks they have gained. Sometimes it‚Äôs best just to walk away. No harm at all in saying this isn‚Äôt a good fit and moving on. Any reasonable person would respect that."
,,juuuustforfun,,,,,And defend the company‚Ä¶. company man.
,,look,,,,,*there
,,Didgeterdone,,,,,"Yes.   Do y‚Äôall have one of those signs up that tells about ‚ÄúMission Statement‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompany Values‚Äù for folk to read when they come to visit your building?

The one closest to my position gets paid less than me so that doesn't help me much lol, I do however hear what people in my position get paid for in other companies, with the same or less experience as I and it is more than what I get. Thing is, those are bigger companies with more resources to give to their employees. Would it be fair for me to ask the same being in a much smaller company, do you think?"

Is my boss a micromanager or am I a bad employee?,14wvw6s,No_Version_1655,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/14wvw6s/is_my_boss_a_micromanager_or_am_i_a_bad_employee/,148,169,1689092547.0,
,,Ihatemylife8,,,,,"Is your boss a micromanager, yes. Should you be texting and playing games at work? Probably not, I personally wouldn't be upset if my team was on their phones or listening to a video or audiobook while working, we all do that provided all their work is getting done for the day. If you're taking 5 minutes to find a new video to watch every 10 or 15 minutes then maybe. At the end of the day you can either have a conversation with your manager about it or look for a new job. If you choose the latter don't leave without something new lined up first"
,,jinkies3678,,,,,Both things can be true.
,,Tyrilean,,,,,"You are in the unfavorable position of being visible from your boss‚Äôs desk. A lot of managers are woefully under equipped for their jobs, and will only care about what they can see at any given moment (reactive, rather than proactive). 

They don‚Äôt care about the other workers because they don‚Äôt see them. But you‚Äôre right there. 

I‚Äôd see if there‚Äôs some way you could move desks. If not, you might want to move jobs. This won‚Äôt end well for you."
,,juanshaftpatel,,,,,"if your boss is micromanging everyone.. then they are the problem...

,,SnooMacarons4754,,,,,"I think that what is bothering OP a lot more than anything is seeing how she gets scolded for being relaxed once in a while when the whole office gets to play golf and chat it up during work. 

I used to have an office manager that would be on her phone ALL day long. She would watch movies in her room and leave the office to get her nails done hours at a time... HOURS. If a nail chipped, she was gone to the salon. But guess what... everyone got to be on their phones. Maybe not Netflix status, but we got to be our phones as long as we got our work done which we always did. We were a team of hard workers.

After that position I moved on to be an office manager myself at a practice and after working there for 6 months, I took my phone out for the very first time because my OLD job was calling me! I was so surprised and wondered if there was an emergency. There were no patients that day and it was only her and I at the office and I got on the call and was on it for like 3 minutes. After I hung up I went back to working and the doctor came out and started yelling at me. I left not too long after that for completely different reasons (something drastic happened in my personal life), and the doctor was extremely sad that I was leaving. 

It can start to feel very draining and burnt out when you're expected to work every second of your job. This doctor specifically would also be watching me do my work. I cleaned up her whole office, her billing, her late fees and collected most of her money from patients and she STILL was watching my every move lol and she was so sad when I left. Some people just don't get what type of environment they're creating."
,,WorkRelatedBS1,,,,,"You sound like the new marketing associate at my office. I heard her telling similar stories (except her boss is actually ‚Äòworking from home‚Äô with a new baby). Your boss is a micromanager and nothing will change that. Stay and get the experience so you can move on or just move on. If you‚Äôre working in an environment where you can‚Äôt take a 5 min breather but your co-workers F around for 1/2 the day, that‚Äôs going to get real toxic real fast."
,,sephiroth3650,,,,,"I think this is a case where it's a little of column A, and a little of column B.  Boss sounds like she hovers and micromanages a bit.

,,Pleasant-Cycle-1991,,,,,"Half of people commenting probably baby boomers or something. It‚Äôs 2023 that‚Äôs micromanaging and it is harassment/bullying because it‚Äôs a pattern of behavior that is creating toxic work environment. Let her boss know probably won‚Äôt do anything for you, but you will feel better that you spoke up and advocated for yourself. Then start looking for new job."
,,vegdeg,,,,,"As you have described it, yes they sound like a micromanager.

You need to start documenting and take these microaggressions to HR as they are creating a hostile work environment."
,,Upstairs_Expert,,,,,"Reframe it. Rather than calling it micromanaging, call it harassment."
,,toandfro9,,,,,"So, you're mad that your employer expects you to work for the hours you're getting paid.  Your entire post is about being upset that you can't fuck off at work and get paid for it.  Did 'research' to find out how much other people fuck off. Consider yourself lucky,  I'da bounced your lame ass long ago"
,,nite0001,,,,,"It feels like your boss is trying to prove herself in the eyes of her peers. You may not know this, but you will as you get older... there is no problem with going over her head to her boss and let them know how you feel about her management style. 

However, you first need to set the bar with her first. So if you feel the way you do... schedule  a time to speak with her. In that meeting, let her know how you feel about the job. This is important, do NOT make it about her. Ask her point blank, Are you a micro manager or are you one of those managers that let people do their job. Explain to her that you have work in both scenarios and that you work better when I'm able to do my job without having much supervision. Then ask her (because she's been watching you), how do you feel about my work thus far and how it gets done, have you heard or seen anything that needs to be addressed? Ask, has any of my co-worker been speaking about my work and do I need to be aware of any concerns that need to be addressed?

Here the kicker that should be an awakening for her... tell her, that I have no problems going and taking things up the chain of command, if I feel that I'm being treated differently than what I've seen others do around here.   


What you're doing is setting the tone and when you start a new job... you these are the things you need to speak to about to, to your manager and let them know that I'm a good employee and will work to my best abilities... but I also have standards that I work well at and will point them out to you as needed as you should to me as well.

Hope this helps..."

Thank you"
,,One_Gas_9535,,,,,Yes it seems to me that your boss is a micromanager. You deserve to be trusted to accomplish your work. No one works every minute of the day. Start looking for a new job.
,,Previous_South2756,,,,,"I think she is micromanaging you more than the others because you are new and they aren't.  New people are always held to a higher standard because they haven't yet proven themselves. Is that unfair?  Maybe.  But it is also understandable.  Like, I might notice an employee checking her Facebook page way more than she should, but it doesn't bother me because I know she knows what needs to get done and I know she has either done it already or will get to it soon enough.  But I don't have the same trust with a newbie."
,,Funny_Struggle_8901,,,,,That‚Äôs enough for me to quit. Work isn‚Äôt supposed to be unreasonable.
,,HelixViewer,,,,,"I have spent years managing task and people.  I define a task that I want complete and when.  I do not tell them how to do the task or what tool to use unless they ask.  I work mostly with salaried engineers so I did not worry about how many hours were used.  Usually the deadlines push us more toward the 60 hour per week area.  Generally such people do not waste time.  They do take long lunches and take breaks whenever they want.

To me micromanagement is telling people what color the handle of the screwdriver must be.  If they want to know what tool I would use, I tell them.  I avoid telling professionals how to do things.  As one moves up the management chain one is placed in charge of things that one does not know how to do.  

I have had the occasion of needing something complete and finding the engineer in the cafeteria reading the paper.  I do not ask how long they have been in the cafeteria, I ask if my work for next Friday will be finished on time?"
,,LiquidSoCrates,,,,,"You‚Äôre on your phone too much and your boss has taken notice.

,,,,,,,"1) your post reads like you‚Äôre mad you don‚Äôt want to work the entire time you‚Äôre being paid to work. And you‚Äôre even trying to justify this by doing research. 
2) your boss does seem like she is micromanaging, and probably because she doesn‚Äôt trust you. But it also seems like she has pretty good reason not to trust you. Honestly I can tell by this post along I wouldn‚Äôt want you on any of my teams. 
3) if she micromanages everyone, she‚Äôs not a good leader. If she micromanages just you, she probably is a good leader and it‚Äôs you that should gain some self awareness."
,,grim-hunter,,,,,"Yes she is a Mirco manager, however you are still new you should be doing everything by the book I would say first 6 months. 4 months in and she is catching you not working. You have to build trust and relationship with her then you can goof off. If they never change switch jobs easy !"
,,dlr1965,,,,,Who would you complain to that she is harassing you for playing games and texting during work hours?
,,DontDMMeYourFeet,,,,,"It sounds like you are a bad employee. Most managers aren‚Äôt micromanagers unless they don‚Äôt trust you, and your manager clearly doesn‚Äôt trust you.

The things your managers complaining about are completely reasonable. If you need to do something person, go pretend to take a shit like everyone else."
,,,,,,,"It sounds like your primary problem is that you are in easy view of the boss. Therefore, easy for a boss to supervise you constantly.  What I might recommend to remedy this situation is find a way to move your desk. I dont know the layout of your office, but perhaps you could ask to move so you can be next to a window."

,,astrotim67,,,,,"Yes you have a micromanager as a boss and a dysfunctional work culture.

Your boss micromanaging sounds like she's insecure about performance. Does she have other direct reports and is she the same with them?

If I take at face value the other comment where your colleagues can work or play on whatever they want as long as they hit their objectives...well it sounds like you have a very transactional culture. Yes they aren't micromanaged but...since they can get their work done and have time to play is there opportunity for them to demonstrate exceptional performance and ascend in their roles and career? Or, are they just ""factory workers"" who are more efficient than the system that gives them work?

If it's the former good! If it's the latter I would look to move elsewhere."
,,Cicadada77,,,,,"You‚Äôre obviously a stand out compared to others so the blame goes on you. She can‚Äôt make them work, but you are appearing weak. Someone‚Äôs gotta take the fall and you shoulda said something slick the first time."
,,xpanderr,,,,,"My view is this‚Ä¶. You only should be micromanaging an employee if you‚Äôre sucking at your job. A manager should be concerned because their head is on the chopping block because someone you hired isn‚Äôt performing. Now if numbers are met etc you shouldn‚Äôt be overseen much, unless due to compliance. Best manager I had when I was a teenager said, ‚ÄúYou make me look good, I‚Äôll make you look good‚Äù."
,,slymarcus,,,,,"From my own personal experience this seems normal for new hires, especially if you've only been there for 4 months. 
Around month 6 your boss should stop micro managemening you.
This is based on my own experience with jobs though, so take it with a grain of salt"
,,Affectionate_Salt351,,,,,"She‚Äôs a micromanager. It‚Äôs ridiculous to hover to this degree. As long as you‚Äôre meeting whatever quota she sets, etc., she‚Äôd be better off to just ‚ÄúShhhhhh.‚Äù Bad managers like this lose employees who are getting the work done and end up with a revolving door. 

If she‚Äôs already being this old school, it‚Äôs best to start searching for another job ASAP. It sounds like she‚Äôs drunk on power and acting like you‚Äôre her kid instead of an employee who is doing everything asked of them."
,,Kiki_Very_Broke77,,,,,Ur boss sounds like biatch! You should find another job. I would be miserable if my boss does that.
,,TantoAssassin,,,,,"A leader who micromanages team members can unknowingly (or knowingly) make their lives difficult. Specifically in tech when you don‚Äôt know details about low level designs that your team is working on. Team will begrudgingly spend more time catering to your micromanagement needs than actually working on their tasks. 

I am not surprised to see your boss is a woman. I never faced micromanagement from my previous bosses in last 8 years. When I got a female team lead recently then Baam! I have to update her about every nitty bitty things I am working on every few hours. She is in everyone‚Äôs shoulder. The team dynamic changed a lot after she came on board. We are working more in updating her than actually working on the important tasks."
,,charmed_unicorn,,,,,Run
,,toucancolor,,,,,"When she got mad at you did you make the necessary changes?  How did you respond to her concern?   Did you ask her what she would find an acceptable approach for breaks?  How many of these breaks were you taking during the day?  Those short breaks can really add up.  Does the company have a written policy about not doing non-work activity on their computers?   Is it possible she is getting a report from IT showing all the sites you‚Äôve visited?  Does her Manager ever come through the office?   If so, that would certainly would reflect poorly on her if you were reading up on a festival at the time. Heck, even other coworkers seeing that can impact her.

Consider that you haven‚Äôt been there that long, so she, and others, will be watching you more (like an unofficial probationary period).  If your workload is such that you have a lot of free time, you are better off doing busy work as opposed to things like Wordle because otherwise you are demonstrating that 1) you don‚Äôt have initiative to ask for special projects or where you can assist her or others on the team 2) you might make her consider whether she really needs this position, if it is time to cut your then be a prime target. 

If you need a break I suggest chatting with coworkers instead, because that at least is building relationships and perhaps can be viewed as collaborating."
,,Ok_Presentation_5329,,,,,"I‚Äôd communicate with my boss & ask why her treatment of me is different than my coworkers. I‚Äôd likely bring it up with HR if it‚Äôs egregious & obvious.

It does sound like she‚Äôs trying to manage you out because you‚Äôre not a high performing employee. That‚Äôs my guess. The quality of your work or ability to take direction may lack.

My recommendation? Work harder & longer. Ignore her.

Alternatively? Start looking for a new job, but expect this to happen again if you aren‚Äôt prepared to work harder & take more pride in what you do."
,,Appropriate-Food1757,,,,,She sounds like the worst. Find a new job.
,,McWhiffersonMcgee,,,,,"Every job and every boss is different. Some jobs expect you to work 7.5 hrs of every 8 hr shift. Its what you signed up for.

The golf and chatting seems to be a social norm for the company, why dont you participate and get to know people?

Your boss isnt there for you to manage dont worry about them and what they do.

Dont use work computer for personal use. Easy way to get fired.

If you want a more relaxed job get a more relaxed job.


Is this an ideal work environment? No... But you are making yourself the victim and that isnt going to help anyone."
,,EdnaMode622,,,,,In the office m-f? You‚Äôre already at a company that won‚Äôt embrace change. Move on
,,ATypicalXY,,,,,"Look elsewhere starting yesterday. 

Any DECENT company to work for these days has AT MINIMUM, a hybrid schedule. (If working in corporate or office atmosphere). If the job you have or applying for does not offer this, do not work there."
,,MathMan1982,,,,,"I am first sorry you are having to deal with this.  I would like to know more details, like how often this occurs, how often/the amount of time/ you look things up, and your overall work ethic. If you are doing good work, getting things done that are supposed to, and have a good rapport with the company, I see no harm in this.  If there is lack of work getting done, or quality, or any other problems in general I could see this being an issue.  Unfortunately sitting next to a boss that has full view of you isn't the best either. I don't think anyone would want that and it's almost an unfair disadvantage to others. Does you boss comment on other's like this? Does your boss reprimand others?  Does your boss move around the room?  Either way, I hope it get's better and your boss doesn't seem to be handling this very well from what I've heard.  Fairness is the key here, and I would recommend having a meeting with your boss one to one to come up with a win win situation. Maybe you could ask, ""Can I occasionally change the music and look up something every now and then, like a 1 or 2 minute breather every hour or so as long as I'm getting my work done?  You are also still somewhat new and I have found when I start new jobs in the past I'm a bit more watched.  Anyway hope for the best."
,,nubious,,,,,"Yes, you are being micromanaged.  It‚Äôs not a good way to manage but at the end of the day your currently under a microscope.  You can argue and try to flip the narrative but that‚Äôs usually fruitless.  I would recommend asking for clarification around the job requirements.   If you feel lien music makes you more productive then say so and try to come to a compromise.  Make sure the boss knows that you want to improve and show a good attitude.  Make an effort until your reputation or your manager changes.  If your boss is reasonable then eventually they‚Äôll loosen the reigns and you can relax.  If they aren‚Äôt reasonable after you take these actions then you have a better case with HR for harassment.

Outside of that if the job is miserable when you can‚Äôt check our occasionally then you may have a decision to make. 

Also, try to switch desks, just make sure the reason is good and that you don‚Äôt ask to to do it for a while."
,,BjornReborn,,,,,"It's both. Generally, it's respectful to not be on your phone unless it's an emergency or your boss has already given the OK to use your phone during downtimes. 

For the festival, I would be a little ticked too. Why couldn't you have waited until after your shift to look it up? Why couldn't you do research on it on your own time? 

It's not for the company, stop wasting time. 

Stop playing Wordle. 

I'd tone down the personal time on your job to just 5-10 minutes at a maximum. 

Your boss while yes, is a micromanager, you are also an employee doing a lot of personal tasks on company time."
,,XuWiiii,,,,,"You‚Äôre new. You‚Äôre going to be under the lens until another newbie comes along and you no longer have to be baby sat like the rest of the crew. 

I‚Äôd move desks if possible, make playlists for work so I‚Äôm not deciding what to listen to on company time and have downtime with the coworkers instead of alone so I‚Äôm not singled out"
,,,,,,,"I've had a couple office jobs and they were usually pretty lax. If I had time between tasks or met a project deadline and I was waiting for something new I could look at my phone or facebook no problem. Usually, as long as I met deadlines/presentations my boss did not care. 

As long as you're completing the work, then yes, your manager seems like the micro-manager from hell. Either way, I'd start looking for my exit plan. Save face, keep your nose down and your manager off your back until you've secured a new job and move on gracefully."
,,Dimple_from_YA,,,,,"So i'm one of the lead administrators here in the company I work for.  I am the tech director.   I am very well liked because I am lenient. But at the same time i dislike being taken advantage of.   I absolutely ***HATE*** micromanaging.  if you see me micromanaging...you need to becareful, because that means i'm ready to fire you. 

I don't care if you watch a youtube video, i don't care if you listen to music, i don't care if you talk all day... if i give you a project and that project isn't completed with quality by x date, you will get a warning. 

I also don't respond well to people asking me the same question over and over and over again.  i will explain 3 times.  if by the third time you want me to explain it again... then i will start micromanaging.  it shows you are not qualified for the position you're in... and be ready to get the pink slip.   Either quit, or get fired.   No hard feelings.   i have 4 employees who absolutely wouldn't want to lose me as their boss.. and they produce EXCELLENT work.   but apart from those 4, i have 4 other positions that keep getting turned over due to me getting rid of people.   I need people who are devoted to work, and use their skill and creativity.  

&#x200B;

Now on the other hand, we have our quality manager, who is a certified micromanager.  I've never seen someone who loses their cool so much.   She is obsessed with telling everyone that they're wrong, that they should be working, shouldn't be on the phone etc.  She is VERY disliked by employees.   I actually like her, because she makes sense... i may not agree with her managing style.. but she is damn good at what she does.   The majority of the time, she is right.   But she is very devoted to her employees.  She wants her employees to be a certain way.    That may drive her employees to quit, or if they are as stubborn as she is.. they will put up a fight... and they will prove themselves.   It takes time, but eventually they come out like steel.  She doesn't like overturning her positions.  She wants excellent quality assurance and control people but she wants them to work HER way. 

&#x200B;

Now, really ask yourself.  WHOLEHEARTEDLY... do you want the micromanager boss or the lenient boss?"
,,ascendinspire,,,,,Change seats. Relocate your body. Get away from her or send out your resume.
,,stevegannonhandmade,,,,,"At this point (and not being there for very long) you need to earn trust from your boss.

I think that a boss needs to GIVE trust to team members, and then EARN the trust of the team.  However...  since you are already in this spot...

IF you want to continue there (and be successful) you'll need to earn trust by staying on task, and going above and beyond expectations.  

IF you have the opportunity/balls, you should ask your boss for a 1 on 1... out of the office, getting coffee or something.  Be honest, frank, admit to not always staying on task, stating how you feel about the hovering (while understanding that most bosses have NOT been trained in ANY way, and are often fearing for their own jobs), and stating that you hope to earn their trust.  Ask if they can allow you some time to do that, hopefully without hovering, etc... and you will provide the expected results.  Then provide MORE than expected.

Your job (I believe) is to make YOUR BOSS successful.  If you do that then (most of the time) you will gain the trust of your boss, and they will let you do your thing.  That should be your goal... do what your boss wants you to do, and make them be/look successful (within reason of course)."
,,Fanabala3,,,,,"I went through this crap.  I was hired under a different manager, but she moved on.  New manager comes in and immediately takes issue with me.  The position was technical, and she had no clue about what we did.  I realized later on she scoped out the employees prior to taking the position and the previous manager said I was the new guy and learning the position.  She took that as I was ill prepared for it and should not be there.  Anyway, I had to deal with her threats of write ups and scrutiny about my position.  Along with the anxiety of one on ones with her.  She was eventually removed from the position for other things, but as I look back, I should have gone to HR when it got bad.  Yes, HR is only there to protect the company, but they absolutely do not want the company to get slapped with a lawsuit due to a boss that is a bully.  Make record of interactions you have had with this manager to HR because then they can start an investigation which may get to the manager‚Äôs manager (which your manager will not want and may make them eventually back off)."
,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"Here's what I've seen in my years in the job market most managers will not mind if you are listening to an audiobook or videos while working if your work allows for that. Most will also not mind if you take a break/breaks as long as your job gets done.

However, as employees, we are agreeing to work while we are on work hours. We are not entitled to automatic free time while on the clock that's why you were hired for a job. We should not base our actual working hours on what the internet says most employees do since we are paid for 100% of hours and not 60% (especially if you are hourly). Thankfully most jobs are not this intense and will allow time to breathe and regroup/recharge.

Perhaps you could look for a different job in the meantime, but make sure the next manager you get is not micromanaging. Or the other option is to try to win that manager over. Also when you are the newbie you will always be supervised more. It's possible that when you get a new employee after you that she will turn her focus on them rather than on you. You can also see if you can switch around your desk area so it's not directly in her sight.

It all depends on how bad it gets for you and how much you want to take from her. If you just feel super stressed out by her micromanaging then you can start looking fro another job in the meantime.

Best wishes. Keep us posted."

,,zanskeet,,,,,"I work in upper level management. From my perspective, if it was a case that they felt like you were a bad employee, then there'd be documentation, corrective actions, meetings with HR, performance improvement plans, and so on. If none of that has happened, and your manager does feel like you are not doing well, then your manager isn't making an effort to support you and to communicate their expectations - making them the one at fault here. Often times it's not a case that someone is a bad employee, but rather it's a bad supporting environment for their particular learning style or learning pace.   


Anytime I have one of my managers come to me and tell me that there's a situation similar to this where they are constantly watching somebody like a hawk and documenting micro infractions throughout the day I respond with something along the lines of, ""Wow, you must be pretty bored at the office if you're prioritizing trivial nonsense such as that. Tell you what, there's a couple other projects we could really use support on. Let's meet next week where I'll bring you up to speed and then I'll loop you in."" It irritates me to high heaven to see managers do things like this to their employees. If goals and deadlines are being met, then I am happy."
,,Kimpynoslived,,,,,"You're doing things that I waited a few years to do and my boss is so micromanaging that I don't even leave personal items (not even chapstick) at my desk.

,,RedOpenTomorrow,,,,,"Some bosses (just like people) will not like you and make your life more difficult than it needs to be.

,,ph1294,,,,,"Talk to your boss. 

Tell them what you‚Äôre saying here. If you‚Äôre not living up to their expectations, they need to express that healthily. If they‚Äôre not unhappy with your work, they need to understand that they‚Äôre sending mixed signals by interrupting you.

Good luck. If they‚Äôre human, they‚Äôll understand - ‚Äúleave me alone unless there‚Äôs a problem.‚Äù But if they hit you with the ‚ÄúI just want you to be your best self!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for your maximum performance!‚Äù Then it‚Äôs time to go.

,,SweetCosmicPope,,,,,"Some bosses are weird about optics.

I used to spend my lunch break eating at my desk and checking my socials at a previous job.  I was a hard worker, and my former colleagues have since told me that they can't keep up since I left and I took a lot of expertise with me.

Anyway, somebody in upper management came by while I was on lunch.  Later in the day I get called into my boss's office telling me I need to stop checking my socials at lunch because it's not a good look.  I probed on this a bit, because to my knowledge social media use was acceptable at work provided we weren't sharing work stuff and it was work appropriate.  He said yes, it's allowed, but one of the bigwigs came through and if we're looking at social media it looks like we're not working."
,,birdeye12345,,,,,I‚Äôd bring it up in a 1:1 and also.. why is she so busy worrying about what YOURE doing instead of doing her own damn work?! Lol
,,appolloniancats,,,,,"you are fairly new at this gig and you are already showing a micromanaging boss that you do need the micromanaging. 

my piece of advice is stop the 5 minutes here and there looking at personal things, playing games. You are here to work, that is what they are paying you for. concentrate on the job and she may just stopping watching you.

The excuse of ""well I get my work done"", what could you be doing with that additional on-the-clock work time? Help others out? learn a new skill set? Impress your boss with additional work completed? 

Once she realizes you really want to work, she may stop looking constantly at you, start trusting you and may encourage you to play music at work.

in the meantime your job is to impress her and get your work done, not your personal stuff.

If the requirements are too low then increase the e requirements for everyone, if some are struggling with the workload then your effort should be focused there and with challenging the employees that are engaged to do more so they can be recognized.

Of course that‚Äôs only if you want to maximize department output.  If you just want to make sure everyone is working 100% of the time regardless of the outcome then you‚Äôre just a bad manager."
,,Polarized_x,,,,,">Most managers aren‚Äôt micromanagers unless they don‚Äôt trust you

I wish I could agree with you, but this is so far off-base in my experience that it hurts lmao.  


I'm more productive at my current job than I've ever been at any prior job, and it's with a manager that tells us ""so long as your work gets done, I'm not gonna bother you. I'll check in with you and you can ask me questions if you need to."" And they were very up-front about this from the start.  


I can listen to music, if there's down-time I can watch a few videos, I can go ten minutes over my lunch break without feeling like the world is ending. The lack of feeling like I **have** to constantly be busy because someone's breathing down my neck has done wonders for my ability to produce for my job.  


At every other job I've had before this, there was a mentality of ""if you're not always busy with something, then you're doing it wrong"" regardless of if they ""trusted"" you or not, and the work environment suffered for it so heavily that often times nobody would stay.   


I'm not saying that people should be lazy/slack off, but being able to weave throughout your workday with these little things should not warrant being reprimanded so long as you're producing results and getting your work done."

,,sarmye,,,,,"This person is correct.  I'm not a boomer, I work in 2023 like the rest of us, and I am in HR and Employment Law.  A boss that wants the employee to work (actually work!) is not harassment or bullying.  Honestly, I think a lot of folks have forgotten that you are getting PAID to WORK... you don't HAVE to be there, you choose to be there, and in return you are compensated.  The expectation is that you do what they tell you to do, regardless of whether it is fun or not.  If you are miserable, go somewhere else, but forget calling it illegal.  A toxic work environment is truly that, but it is also not illegal, fyi.  And further, saying this kind of thing takes away the actual harm that is true illegal work behavior, harassment or discrimination, which is genuinely toxic."
,,Pleasant-Cycle-1991,,,,,"Think about it for a second. Bullying is when someone misuse their power through repeated patterns or behaviors that causes the person physical, emotional, or psychological harm. This person here is absolutely harmed psychologically. I mean they are on Reddit to vent. And harassment is also using intimidation or pressure. Which is exactly what she is doing here."
,,Nsjsjajsndndnsks,,,,,It's a form of control abuse. The boss is an abuser and op is the abuse victim
,,Pleasant-Cycle-1991,,,,,Bullying isn‚Äôt just for 14 year olds boys in middle school. Unfortunately it‚Äôs also at work among grown ups. People are terrified to call a boss a bully they would give so many excuses for their behaviors but the truth is there are so many bosses out there that are bullying employees. Go look up the behavior of a bully and the effect of it.
,,vegdeg,,,,,"How so? For op's own good, what would you recommend instead and why do you think this is bad advice.

,,vegdeg,,,,,Nice alt account.
,,vegdeg,,,,,"Another redditor not knowing what they are talking about:

You are thinkin about hostile environment from an EEOC perspective:

Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive.

[https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment)

Which would relate to protected class.

The question is not one of legality however, vs what an organization commonly calls hostile work environment.

Google has failed you."
,,vegdeg,,,,,Never said they were and anyone that thinks that is stupid. Anyone that thinks they need to say that...

 He wanted to do stuff our master schedulers were doing, and I tried to explain to him that he wasn't ready for that. It was an awful 8 weeks, and after he asked me for a reference, I couldn't, in good faith, say I would ever put my neck out for him."
,,Adorable_Problem3541,,,,,"As the thread is few days old I'm gonna jump right in and ask about something unrelated. If you don't want to answer my question it's really no bother. You mentioned your occupation and that's what prompted me to reply.

I'm in a very strange situation and can't get my head around it. I'm employed and have proven my productivity and work ethic is beyond and of their expectations. My issue is with the tedious micro manager and one particular bug bear has cropped up that she just won't leave alone and it's honestly making me miserable lol.

I've been employed by them for 1 year btw and have been at the same post throughout.

Occasionally, on an ad hoc basis I pick up my laptop and dial in to work in my own time for a period I want. To just make sure that work is ticking over. It's a public sector job so quite low level and nothing fancy. Processing is the name of the game with my work, but I thrive if given autonomy and make things work so well.

So, this additional time I put in, is my own decision and based on a good work ethic. I've made it clear I don't want overtime or any other compensation. No flexi time or time off in lieu. Just me being the good guy and looking out for the team. 

Well here is the weird thing. She has directed that I stop. To the point where she has specified clearly to me that I am not authorised to do additional hours. Knowing full well I seek nothing in return. I challenge it and ask who has given this dictat or what policy / procedure is it lifted from. I never get an answer and the only thing repeated to me is that she (the supervisor) does not want me to do it. I find it very weird but I've told her i will continue because I want that autonomy. Are they going to sack me for having that kind of work ethic? These people are fucking insane.

Thoughts?"
,,Pleasant-Cycle-1991,,,,,"You said it ‚Äúgetting paid to work‚Äù not getting paid to be abused or bullied by a manger. Do you have any idea the effects of this manager behavior on employees? Since you‚Äôre in HR, have you ever asked an employee how this made them feel? You will notice it‚Äôs not just causing stress but also other mental health issues like depression. Is that what we are getting paid for?"
,,Achleys,,,,,"I‚Äôm not saying his manager is being reasonable. She‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not saying what she‚Äôs doing doesn‚Äôt create an environment that demotivates people. It does. I lead a large team and would never do what his boss is doing. Ever. 

But insisting he work while he‚Äôs at work isn‚Äôt harassment, FFS. It‚Äôs not bullying either. Nor is it *abuse* as another commenter said. 

It‚Äôs shitty management. No question. But terms like harassment and bullying and abuse are big, heavy words that have very specific legal meanings that simply do not apply to this situation."
,,secretsecrets111,,,,,"What OP is doing is legitimate cause for coaching. You really think that HR is going to side with the employee when even he describes the situation as basically ""my boss keeps catching me goofing off and not working and it's making me mad""?

Just because he claims harassment or ""microaggression"" does not mean HR will agree. Telling an employee to not be on their phone or watching videos during work hours is not harassment and I don't see anything he wrote that a reasonable person would consider harassment. The solution to this is to stay off your damn phone at work if your boss is on high alert about it. If he goes to HR they are extremely likely to take the bosses side unless she has done something terrible that OP has failed to mention."
,,showersneakers,,,,,"It‚Äôs garbage advice - for 2 reasons - A, and most importantly - it puts them in the worst mindset for work, always looking for negative BS, documenting it and thinking they are building a case.

B- legally- unless they are a protected class or whistle blowing- hostile work environment like that is perfectly legal"
,,inahd,,,,,"Vegdeg, it has been a pleasure to watch you step in to comment on a subject that seems absolutely in your wheelhouse to comment on, and see this sort of ridiculous situation play out. 

My only hope is that someone else qualified to comment steps in, and can give a little support to what you're saying. I have no idea about any of this stuff, but I can absolutely see how hostile a work environment could become, being constantly harassed about little things.

Now could someone explain to me why my friend told me that her child takes tests at school in front of a computer, that monitors their eye movement and scolds them if they aren't looking at the screen? Or Amazon drivers, or employees that are not allowed to sit down for 8 hours a day? I do believe that insane things like this existing is what makes everyone doubt your recommendation. 

What exactly makes you think that HR would look at those facts and side with the employee, when it appears completely acceptable for these other atrocities to occur across the spectrum of employers?"
,,Funny-Berry-807,,,,,"You're a moron.

,,TheExpandingMind,,,,,"I have worked in, and been more successful in, more fields than you have, and I promise you that.

There is no such thing as a job that **requires**, as a baseline, ""work every single minute of a shift"". A nuclear submarine pilot doesn't work every single minute of their shift. People who work kitchens on cruise lines for 14 hour days don't work every single minute. A nurse will usually have a few moments to sit and breathe, and the nights where they can't are oft associated with causing burnout (and being the result of short-staffing). 

Every field you listed is associated with dropping numbers, burnout, and general unhappiness due to staffing issues.
The job isn't requiring all that energy dedication, the employers are just screwing their workers over by skeleton crewing.

There is a big difference.

Also, rephrasing what people have said to make them sound more egregious is a sign of bad faith, as literally no one present has claimed to support employees ""looking at their phone until lunch break."" 

Why should I continue interacting with you if you are going to stoop to those levels to feel intellectually superior?

Look hoss, you can shake your fist at the sky and yell at clouds all day, but better staffing and interspersed ""downtime"" are the keys to combating burnout and reducing turnover."

So you may be blowing their budget without meaning to."
,,ShutUpAndDoTheLift,,,,,"Being told to do work by your boss when caught fucking around on your phone or scrolling through YouTube videos is not bullying.

,,vegdeg,,,,,">ly ""my boss keeps catching me goofing off and not working and it's making me mad""?

I don't have time for a full reply, but basically, if you document things like:

I'm disabled too and she once referred to the reasonable adjustments made (more time allowed to wfh) as a reason for me not to work additional hours. I told her flat out not to bring my disability into the argument. she backed off.

My advice is not to report to HR and keep records of incidents for a lawsuit instead in case things go south. Again, do NOT trust HR."
,,vanillaroseeee,,,,,"Who cares if the person never missed a deadline or left work early? That is entitlement. When you work for a company or a boss, you don‚Äôt get to have free reign in what you do. If they ask you to do something and you don‚Äôt like it, then quit. Simple 

I do think the boss is micro-managing and treating others with differently which isn‚Äôt cool. But despite the person being done and not leaving work early ever etc they deserve something from it? A cookie? That‚Äôs not how life works. A company is about profits at the end of the day. Someone taking away productive time from a company is taking aware profits of accomplishing work to maximize them. Those are what breaks are for.

OP should leave to find a better boss so she isn‚Äôt micro managed but realize that‚Äôs not the norm behavior and would have any manager question it.

In fact most other jobs workers never look at their phones at all or even sit down except on breaks ONLY. Healthcare workers, manual labor etc. are some examples."

,,secretsecrets111,,,,,"That's great for you. Not all managers are like that, and not all HR departments would agree. It's a gray area, but for OP's case, it doesn't sound like the smartest thing to do. Thanks for your opinion, have a great day."

""HR will side with whomever the facts side with.""

Never did I say HR is on the side of employees nor manager.

If you have been at 5 companies and had issues with HR at all 5 you are the common denominator."
,,vegdeg,,,,,"Someone needs to learn the difference between an opinion and a fact.

Me stating I do something is a fact for example, which you can then argue about the truthfulness or not. An opinion would be how I think my action that I know I conduct is perceived.

,,Chuck-Finley69,,,,,"53 year old here. I was in my profession for the last 32 years. First, about 15-16 years, corporate employee. The next 15-16 years, independent contractor.

When COVID-19 hit, I needed a JOB to pay the bills since I just sold my client book to my partner in preparation to buy another client book.

I struggled making a resume and then went into a depressed state, because it was COVID-19, my 83 year old mother passed away from natural causes but I was sad.

I went to unemployment site and the internet and updated my resume enough for a customer service job. A  recruiter contacted me and 3 years later I still have the eventual sales job that fits me over that customer service  position that was foot in the door.

There are companies that value experience and YOU have the degree. Nobody can it take away from you, ever.

Do what I did to escape the funk. Take rest of today off and quit spinning your wheels. Tomorrow, wake up, thank whatever Supreme being you believe, that you're awake. Somebody in a 10 mile radius didn't wake up today and their family members are crying for them.

Put one foot in front of the other, walk to your desk/table, sit down and make a list of your tasks for the day.

1. Eat breakfast - shower, get dressed
2. Report to your desk/table as your ""job"" and search for resumes in experience field and copy them using your information.
3. Take a 15 minute break like any job.
4. Go back to your job. You're expected to have a basic resume by lunchtime.
5. Take an hour lunch and relax.
6. Go back to your desk/table and now search for some jobs you'd like to apply for and apply for those jobs until your next 15 minute break.
7. Take break
8. Finish out your day applying for more jobs.

‚âà=========

Next day follow the same actual steps but spend first part of day improving your resume. Second part of day apply to new round of jobs and even reapply to earlier jobs with your updated resume. 

You have nothing to lose, all that anyone can say is no. Every no is one step closer to yes just for an interview. In my old profession, it could take 100 attempts to just get interview/appointment, then 5-10 interviews/appointments to get sale/job.

You are responsible for your own path. You may not be where you hoped, but you can start today and everyday after this to make choices to improve your life.

,,,,,,,"Well your biggest issue is you've resigned yourself to this identity that you're fucked.

You mention mental health several times preventing you from working several times, but you also mention how you might have to work at a fast food joint to survive.

First off: fuck you. 

I just came from McDonalds and a young girl was interviewing there, dressed up and giving her all for low wage. Not expecting to WFW, or blah blah. I can't explain just how much respect I have for those individuals. It is hard work, and somehow everyone thinks its beneath them. Like it's a ""last resort.""

Fuck you. And fuck anybody who thinks fast-food work isn't hard, honorable work. It 100% is. 

I assure you that girl I saw is not ""beneath"" anybody reading this - especially you. 

So how are your mental health issues keeping you from working/interviewing at X entry-level career role, but not fast-food? The latter arguably being much more difficult work.... 

Sounds like there's a lot more at play here. My guess is your own ideas of respect, expectations of employment versus how severe or not severe your mental health. You may have mental health issues (MOST PEOPLE DO), but they're not keeping you from working/growing: you're keeping you from working/growing.

  
The biggest lie you've ever been told is that there are ""depressed"" people and ""not depressed"" people. Chalk that up to big pharma trying to sell pills.

No. Everybody gets depressed. Everybody struggles. Everybody has doubt. There is no ""depressed"" or ""not depressed"" person. There are people with complex emotions. That's it.

My philosophy at this point is any job is better than no job and I can work on myself and my skills while working any job. It doesn‚Äôt have to be related to what I want to do but it would be nice. Having a temp job, an admin job that pays 1/2 of what my previous salary was or a fast food job is better than my current state (which is homeless btw.) 

Here‚Äôs my plan: 

On Monday I start applying to staffing companies. Express is pretty big and might have an office near you. 
By the end of the week if I‚Äôve heard nothing, I‚Äôm going to reach out to a labor focused staffing company that offers training in my area. It won‚Äôt be glamorous work or something I‚Äôd put on my resume, but it‚Äôs work. If they don‚Äôt have availability , move on to fast food etc. 

Once I have work, my plan is to get back into therapy and work towards saving for trainings and certs. Once those are done and I‚Äôm feeling better about myself, I‚Äôd like to get back out there. 

This job market is hell. If you have 60% of the qualifications on a job application apply. You may be surprised who calls you.

>It has got to the point I might have to work at a fast food joint just to survive.

So? Plenty of people work in fast food. Do you think you're somehow better than them, or too good to work at a fast food place? Get over yourself.

As others have said, it's your mental health that is the issue. Nothing is wrong with your degree, and you have to stop blaming it or you'll never be able to address the real issue.

I once got therapy at a center that offered help priced on a sliding scale based on income. So the less income you have, the less you pay. You should look for programs and places that offer similar things in your area.

,,abbylynn2u,,,,,"So my expectation is that you will not find a position necessarily using your degrees if you've been out of the field or have never ever used them. It's not that the degree is useless you just haven't used it due to your health issues.

1. Get signed up with your local WorkSource office and attend all of the workshops. Part of the depression in job searching in feeling like you are alone in this journey. When you go to the workshops you'll find there are tons of folks out searching for jobs.
Also, your contact person can help you navigate your SSD and SNAP requirements for employment. 

WorkSource usually has a team that works with clients on SSD amd or mental health issues. Often these are sourced out to a partner company. 
Ps... you need to advocate for yourself in that you need help navigating this process.

2. Limit the scope of the job you are search for. Someone above mentioned Project Manager..... that's a definite no. Too high stress for a depressed introvert.

3. If your health condition is not physical but mental health, then Walmart, Target, grocery stores, Amazon, warehouse jobs

4. Sign up with many temp agencies that can send you out on assignments. Even if they are only for a week or two. Then they become your listed employer to meet the SNAP requirements. 

Jobs.... to search for
Payroll, accounts payroll, receptionist, administrative assistant. Insurance companies, hospitals.... There are plenty of decent jobs that are not high customer contact. 

Do you have a car? That you could do gig work driving your car delivery for Instacart or Walmart Spark where you don't have to shop, just pick up and deliver. 

As others have mentioned... Definitely meet with your doctor and counselor updating them that the job search is increasing your depression. This needs to be documented. But also you need to be working with your counselor on how to better manage this. 

Unfortunately, you cannot bury your head in the sand otherwise you'll foresure loose your benefits.

 Will say that in reality you could work 1 or 2 days month at almost any job and bring home more than the 60.00 a month you get in benefits. So part time at a fast food joint or a cleaning service for an office building would cover your benefits. 

All the best"

You're fighting your mental health, age discrimination and who knows what else..

Your FIRST step needs to be to see a psychologist and get a formal diagnosis.. The options open up from there even if it is a job that may seem below what your expectations are.  Between social assistance and work you can make it.

FACT
States get tons of Federal money when people enroll in State programs that are funded by the Federal Govt. 

FACT
Nonprofits get Federal money and Corp donations when needy people approach them. Nonprofits don't solve problems, they perpetuate them. 

I don't know why people think Govt agencies that are staffed with govt employees who get paid regardless of outcomes, care about outcomes. They don't. It's just a job.

Look at all the homeless people in the U.S. They aren't all addicts or have mental health challenges. Wages have been stagnant for years. Most people dont have health insurance.

FACT
State Govt agencies mostly work with judicial reentry candidates who are part of the targeted groups who can't get hired under traditional work methods. They need to be sponsored or bonded through State WOTC work opportunity tax credits to get hired. Those employers exploit them with low pay and high turnover.

FACT
Govt and nonprofits don't solve problems. They want people dependent on them. Ask a Veteran or a homeless person."

,,HouseNumb3rs,,,,,"Nowadays, a college ""degree"" is worthless because that is the bare minimum for hire.  It need to be in something applicable to the company so a fresh grad with proper degree is worth a lot more than an old timer without said degree and require additional training.  I got hired straight from grad and received tons of factory training over the years.  I excelled in digital as opposed to the old guards who only knows analog and refused to learn new things.  If you stagnate, you depreciate in value in 10 years.  As you followed along with my tire tread analogy... you'd pay less for worn treads, eh?

Knowing this, it tells me the focus needs to be on mental health, self esteem, possibly improved people skills, and generally taking responsibility for the direction things have gone so far.

You're 52 and on all kinds of government assistance with a degree and it's everyone elses fault but your own?  What about all the other 52yr olds that grew up similar that are successful and succeeding.  How did they do it??  We all live in a world of shit and have issues.  Some of us complain about it and some of us use it to our advantage and learn how to grow from it.  Maybe you need to read some articles about how to grow from your failures.  Grow up.  We all got problems just like you.
,,,,,,,I agree.  Depression sucks.  If you're depressed find help.  Don't blame the system and life because of your situation.  Get up.  Stand up and get the help you need.

if you go to college ""to get a better job"" then you're missing the point entirely.  A ""degree"" is about education, not job training.  if you want a job, go get a certification."
,,Successful-Two-3140,,,,,Having a degree in anything at all shows at the very least that you can do all the things necessary to actually get a degree. Being able to do those things mean you have some skills and are conscientious enough to show up and do a job. Most employers complain about 2 things- either the people can‚Äôt do what they‚Äôre told or just don‚Äôt. If you start with the attitude that you have a useless you are doing yourself a disservice. Having a slightly unrealistic view of yourself that you can do something is very helpful. Thinking you can lift 100 pounds when you‚Äôve only ever done 95 may help you actually do it. If you‚Äôve only ever lifted 40 you‚Äôre probably going to hurt yourself. Definitely should work on the mental health aspect with the mindset that you‚Äôre actually going to get better somehow but just need help.
,,thepancakewar,,,,,fair point

,,Bender3455,,,,,"I don't like ""beating down"" anyone, but he's made 2 posts about how his degree is useless when it's not the case.  He even mentioned he can't go back for his Masters, but his degree is not the problem.  Whatever he's been doing for the past 20 to 30 years hasn't been working, and he needs to drastically change his mindset about the situation.  If he were 5 years into this, and still in his 20's, I'd be much softer on him.  But he's not.  He's 52, and by now should be completely cognizant about what's holding him back.  He even mentioned having dismal writing skills.....while having a marketing degree??  What did he think it would involve?  He could easily have been working on that during any point in time, and he should have.  He should start now.  Today.  Most jobs are about solving problems. I run 2 businesses, and I hire people that have positive mindsets, unique skillsets, and the ability to solve problems.  But also, the people I hire do not have to have all 3, or even 2.  The OP has shown that he has none of the 3.  If he can work on just 1 of those facets, he'll start to see where he can be valuable to an employer."

If you lived a shitty life and sit back crying about how bad your life is it's your fault you are where you are.  Pull your big boy pants up and do something about your life.  Stop blaming everyone else for the reason you are where you are.  Grow up.  Stop blaming everyone else for your failures.  Move up in life!!  If you're in your 50's and feel like a failure it's your own fault.  Not your moms.  Or your dads.  It's your own fault.  Grow up.  Improve your life.  Do it on your own.  Don't rely on your moms or dads help.  Do it on your own.  It's not your moms or dads fault you're in your 50's complaining about your life.  It's your fault.  Do something with your life.  Grow.  Progress.  Do it for you.  I believe in you . .

How is that so hard to understand higher paid office jobs will require degrees that‚Äôs life and for real reason. You can ignore the all the data on it if you‚Äôd like. So no he wouldn‚Äôt be in the same position he probably wouldn‚Äôt have even been considered for the entry level position without the degree as a degree was required for that to. Not saying you can‚Äôt make good money without a degree cus you can. The work tends to be way more physically demanding while also requiring way more hours of work so pick your poison. The data is clear though on this you can‚Äôt fight it

,,,,,,,"You don't know what the status of his mental health is. Or whether it's even related to his disability. Or whether anything he relayed is even accurate. This is the internet.

But I can tell you that it's very odd that someone would relay their mental health as a blocker to employment, and yet reference how they might have to go work fast food ""even to survive""...which is incredibly team-oriented and customer facing.

It's a equivalent to someone saying ""My mental health prevents me from being a plumber/software engineer/customer service rep/truck driver/whatever  - but I am can work Wendy's.""

As I mentioned in my post, there's differentiator at play not being elaborated on. Probably the OP's own expectations around what their employment should be and respect thereof. Probably something they're not even conscious of.

They may have mental health problems (MOST PEOPLE DO), but the severity or non-severity of mental health problems are not structured around the prudency of what the individual wants.

That's called bullshit."

,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,I just said the same thing having a college diploma is worth it. It just requires work on the degree holders end also. Companies love to cull applicants by who has a degree and who doesn‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs not a stem position any degree goes.
,,thepancakewar,,,,,"wage means nothing when you're 6 figures in debt, living in a city where the cost of living is outrageous and you have to live in a shoe box while paying for theft, car break ins and health issue that accumulate from the stresses cause by the debt you owe. statistics without context is propaganda. this is why college enrollment is dropping and will eventually collapse.  it's not worth it and the student loan crisis proves that."
,,thepancakewar,,,,,data is not clear it's propaganda because you ignored the variables i told you. this isn't boomer years this is the new era and a high wage means nothing with debt and inflation.

,,Blubaughf12345,,,,,EVERY RETAIL STORE HIRES AT MINIMUM WAGE.
,,poKONY_2012,,,,,He wasn‚Äôt an ass. He answered the question that was asked. Sometimes the truth hurts but that doesn‚Äôt mean we need to sugarcoat everything.
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,I mean if you do have a degree you did earn some preferential treatment  even if you don‚Äôt have same experience yet. People with college degrees regardless of the degree in majority perform better in management and leadership roles because of skills acquired while getting a degree. It wouldn‚Äôt be preferential if they didn‚Äôt have data that shows that and data is clear on that front. It sucks because some people truly can be taught on the job and do a solid job and school wasn‚Äôt for them but at the same time  following performance data you have higher chance of choosing a higher performer if they have a degree than without. It screws over that bunch of people though. Only 27% of adult population in usa has a bachelors and 13% has a masters. I was watching a show that I feel explained it best. Having a degree shows you showed up to place for 4 years turned in work on time of decent quality  showing if an employer there is a good chance you won‚Äôt fuck up their business if they choose you. It‚Äôs not 100% accurate  but no system of choosing employees will ever be 100% accurate
,,thepancakewar,,,,,you think it's a coincidence our student loan bubble is in the trillions and you have people begging for their loans to be forgiven?
,,thepancakewar,,,,,no they do not.  networking is objectively better by every single metric.  hell why do you think people crave to go to ivy league schools for the lunches?  it's the connections.  college is a lie.  social mobility is rare.  college gives the lie of improvement but most people stay in their social class so no it is not a life enhance at all.
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,That‚Äôs a completely separate issue from a degree being valuable. Many factors caused that including 1965 higher education act. 90% of the problem is cause by gov guaranteed subprime loans they hand out like candy. Similar to subprime mortgages. Make it easy to get loans it causes problems long term that doesn‚Äôt mean a degree is not valuable. Also a lot of the people begging are people who never finished they borrowed 50k then quit because school wasn‚Äôt for them leaving them in a shitty situation
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,Also if your smart you can get out of school with Minimal loans 20-30k and you‚Äôll be pretty well set if you work hard
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,The whole point of any college is to learn and to network. If people are not taking advantage of the opportunities given that‚Äôs on them. Like I said just having a degree won‚Äôt help you it take more work on your end. It‚Äôs an accolade that looks good. Also staying in your social class doesn‚Äôt mean your not doing better. Being middle class 70k a year in construction vs 70-100k in a white collar job with better benefits is a hell of alot different and better in every way. If you choose to believe college is worthless junk that‚Äôs on you good luck with your life cus it‚Äôs helped me a ton and given opportunities I would not have had but go off.
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,It‚Äôs really a shame you‚Äôve become so jaded you can‚Äôt see the value in a education and educated population.
,,thepancakewar,,,,,it's the same issue you're just ignoring the point to try to justify these expensive pieces of toilet paper being nothing more than a scam for the most part.  You're right the numbers don't lie.  trillions and going up.  i don't have to say more than that.
,,thepancakewar,,,,,college has NOTHING to do with education.  You can get educated on the internet which most are opting to because it cost you nothing and enrollment is collapsing.  My University's enrollment has been cut in half and was dropping pre covid.
,,Loud-Lingonberry-410,,,,,It‚Äôs not the  the same issue they are separate. School should be cheaper causes by something completely different than the value of a degree. College educated people are better work candidates far and large which is why most corporate level jobs require them.

,,Amendus,,,,,"1: the company I worked for got aquired.
2: CEO promised we wouldn't lose our job due to covid.
3: got fired due to covid
4: unemployed for 3 months
5: got hired by a big gaming company!
6: had to resign due to covid and them making false promises.
7: unemployed for another 3 months yay! 
8: gained 10kg due to to stress
9: developed anxiety and panic attacks. 
10: got a job starting in 2021! 

So yeah fuck you 2020 and all the bullshit that came with it.

Edit: can't make a decent list on mobile. F"
,,SkullAngel001,,,,,"Yeah that sucks but you're not alone. My version of 2020 has been happening since late 2017. Started a new job then and a side e-commerce business. Struggled to get it up and running (translation = ran up $40k in credit card debt during the startup process). The 2019 holiday shopping season was less than profitable (while spending $3k in advertising). Been trying to secure an evening/weekend gig to pay down my startup bills since January 2020 and of course...COVID.  I'm still annoyed I didn't use my down time to finally become good at Adobe After Effects. I have a stack of magazines (Motor Trend & Men's Health) that I keep telling myself I'm going to finally get to...but haven't.

Only recently did I get a part-time gig so the pay down has begun; gonna' take a while but my business is starting to pick up this holiday season.

So take it from me, focus is the key to persevering in your journey.  The road to entrepreneurship success is long, lonely, and demoralizing. But it's these failures that teach us how to endure, adapt and conquer. Whether it takes one year or five years, what matters is that you don't stop pushing yourself. 2020 is of no consequence; reassess now and focus on what you can accomplish in 2021.

Also remember, the most successful people in this world didn't become successful on the first try."
,,renan_orleans,,,,,"Thanks for sharing. It helps. Nowadays we only talk about winning and winners. This is not good. I have no idea what to do next year. This is not good. Be bold, folks!"
,,violetmonstermunch,,,,,"I got fired after I was bedridden for a month because of Covid, and I have to go back to living with my abusive parents. I hope 2021 will be better but I kind of doubt it lol."
,,JustJess234,,,,,"I haven‚Äôt found a job this year, at most I only volunteered at two work from home companies and took a few free online courses to attempt boosting my skill set. And I‚Äôve been suffering cabin fever due to COVID."
,,Iradaska,,,,,"thank you, this was brave and inspiring! you tried a lot of things and I am sure they all add up and count on the long run.  I only tried the one thing I set up as a challenge, I started coding. I felt overwhelmed that I have practically given up, and now I feel the same about starting or trying anything else. I am happy that you are fine!"
,,Joshboulderer3141,,,,,"1. I thought that I could beat the pandemic.  
2. I stopped doing a lot of productive graduate research halfway through the pandemic.  Now I‚Äôm behind. 
3. I did not do enough to keep myself healthy during the pandemic, now I have battle scars as a result 
4. I failed to connect with many other people. 
5. I did not keep a schedule, in part because work was from home

Accomplishments:

1. After ten years of being on psych meds, I was able to become totally free from them, including bipolar meds.  
2. I made an effort to meet with other coworkers at restaurants, etc.
3. I was able to get a ton of graduate research done during the first half of the pandemic.
4.  I pursued opportunities that I was very scared of pursuing before.

In short, I feel that coming out of 2020 has made me stronger as a person, in part, because of the circumstances I was faced with during the pandemic."
,,MikeDeansBigRed,,,,,"Keep putting yourself out there, success will come eventually."
,,DiamondShrimp,,,,,"Ended up reading some of your Medium articles after this and really enjoyed them. They‚Äôre definitely unique (esp about passion being subjective).

Keep at it!"
,,eisabai_wit,,,,,Thanks :)
,,Joshboulderer3141,,,,,"Well, that doesn‚Äôt sound like a failure that can be attributed to you.  The company that you worked for failed, not you."
,,eisabai_wit,,,,,So true. Thanks for sharing your story.
"Almost 48, I need a change",13e6uz2,nnikki115,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/13e6uz2/almost_48_i_need_a_change/,38,79,1683761342.0,
,,grrgrrtigergrr,,,,,Same age. Been in marketing my entire adult career. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ tired. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôd do instead though. But if I don‚Äôt change careers in the near future I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll survive to see 58.
,,sweetbitter_1005,,,,,"48 with the same company 27 years. So I feel you with wanting to make a change but not wanting to lose vacation time. I'm already in  corporate, so I'm trying to keep my eyes open for opportunities within my company but in a different department. I think the suggestions you received to look into a role with corporate or another department that doesn't require dealing with customers are great ideas for you to make a change without losing your vacation . Wishing you all the best!"
,,zebjr,,,,,"Can you try to get a corporate job with the company you work with or another in your area. Some times they look for experience like that. 23 years impressive. BTW I have worked in corporate retail. Not now, but almost  20 years."
,,NorCalMikey,,,,,I would look within your company for a position for a support role. Heath & safety would be a good change. No dealing with the public.
,,,,,,,Thank god I have 10 years to go
,,Mindless-Employment,,,,,"I have a friend who worked her way up from cashier to store manager at Home Depot over about 20 years. Eventually she couldn't stand the 80 hour weeks and loony customers any more (this was even before Covid) and got a corporate job with Home Depot as a district HR manager, since being a store manager involved so much HR work anyway. Maybe you could do something similar."
,,SWEATANDBONERS86,,,,,You should go on some kinda big psychedelic trip to find your true path and then you will know what you are really meant for
,,ChuziUzi,,,,,I switch careers every few years. Life‚Äôs too interesting to be doing the same thing for 23 years. Take the plunge and find something new!
,,SelectionNo3078,,,,,"Mortgage lending for 23 years 

Roller coaster income. Currently in the worst spot 

Nobody sees me as anything but this and it is not for me anymore. 

Also going through divorce 

Maybe I should just die."
,,LEMONSDAD,,,,,"Hardest part is leaving and finding something where the pay is comparable. 

Friends dad lost a $90,000 plant supervisor role in 08 and the best he got out of that was a forklift driver position for $10. 

He is now a shift supervisor making $23 an hour.

Thankfully they bought their house in the 90s and can survive of $23 today. 

Some people can jump ship and make more.

It‚Äôs a roller coaster out there trying to find good jobs."
,,manofsteel1941,,,,,Golf course maintenance! It will change your life!
,,wtjones,,,,,Salesforce Admin. You can be ready in six weeks and start at $75k. Do it for a couple of years while you figure out what‚Äôs next.
,,Killa_DaVinci,,,,,Learn to cod
,,Interesting-Bank-925,,,,,"Lean to be an inspector of some sort. You can go places with a clip board and a hard hat. And, you know, inspect stuff. Make sure 
It‚Äôs up to snuff ."
,,nowsian,,,,,"Look at any gold mining jobs in your area, specifically haul truck driver. Not sure where you live, but on the west coast good help is getting hard to find so they are hiring just about anyone..I don‚Äôt mean that as an insult. 

Start out at about 80,000 to drive a truck and really no accountability for hitting anything‚Ä¶as long as you have a pulse and can pass a drug test. Also, at my specific site we‚Äôre required to have a certain amount of women in the workforce so it‚Äôs a even bigger opportunity."
,,Overall_Seat9341,,,,,"You need to change your mindset. Keep the job, but you‚Äôre the manager so you actually have the power over complainers. Also tap into some hobbies you used to really enjoy or take a trip with the family on the weekend somewhere fun. Work life balance needs to be practiced to prevent this sort of burnout"
,,Rower375,,,,,"Take a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù! Go to Europe, backpack the PCT, etc. jobs will be here waiting for you. I am 45. Life is now."
,,Fantastic-Art-3704,,,,,"By now you should be considered an expert in your field, why not look into an auditing role.vwith your corporation or another they should utilize auditors or consultants to go to other stores and see what works and what doesn't work. Other than the travel aspect, being an auditor is an awesome job."
,,nerdwerds,,,,,"Just out of curiosity, how much were you making as a manager of a big box store?"
,,Myviewpoint62,,,,,A career counselor is great idea.
,,The_Lovely_Blue_Faux,,,,,"What would you pursue if you won the lottery and had the option of doing whatever? 

I don‚Äôt mean like go on vacation or relax‚Ä¶ after that. After life returns to boring. What would you do if you didn‚Äôt HAVE to do anything?"
,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"A career counselor can provide valuable guidance and support in identifying your skills, interests, and values. They can help you explore new career paths that align with your strengths and passions. Additionally, they can assist you in assessing your transferable skills from your experience in retail management, which could be valuable in other industries.  
  
Also you could consider taking a career assessment test to [test](https://www.careerfitter.com/free_test/careerbuilder?afid=1710) that could help you identify the career that would fit your work personality."
,,magicity_shine,,,,,I work in construction but plan on becoming a barber when I get tired
,,Frances_P042682,,,,,"Remember, age should never be a limiting factor when it comes to pursuing your dreams and finding fulfillment in your career. So, go ahead and take that leap of faith. Embrace the change and embark on a new chapter that will bring you closer to the career you've always desired. You have the power to shape your own destiny and create a meaningful and fulfilling professional life, no matter your age."
,,Shitty_Drawers,,,,,"OP, transition to a deskside IT role. It beats retails cheeks and you can most likely finesse it into a Work From Home role!"
,,Toadchewer,,,,,"If you're in a pro union state, respiratory therapy. It's only as hard as you want it to be. You can go to an ICU setting for complicated patients. ER if you're nuts. Floor RT and sling nebs. Peds, neonates adults. All different. All going to affect what you do and how hard you work. Same as what type of hospital. Big trauma hospital you'll typically work harder than a small outlying one. Also unlike a nurse you can typically do your thing and move onto the next patient. Doesn't pay as well as nursing and doesn't really open doors to do other things like nursing can but it's great still."
,,illusionofguy,,,,,"What kind of Big box store is it? I came from a Best Buy and went into distribution in the audio and video / custom integration industry. You could easily go from where you are to repoing for a major brand. I've seen career veterans do that all the time. 

Some people fall in love with the new role, but there is the risk of uptight clients. You could also run the risk of less stability than what you have now."
,,MagicalTaint,,,,,"49 here. I spent 10 years chasing my tail in retail management. I kept moving from job to job thinking the next place would be better but it was always just more of the same. Hated every minute of it, worst of all I felt like my work had no meaning or purpose.

I went back to school at 30, I now work in the medical field and moonlight for a large medical device company. My work has purpose, I feel like I'm making an impact and I make more than I ever thought I would. 

At your age, if you aren't satisfied and want to leave your company hopefully your vacation accrued would be paid out as a lump sum. Dump it into a high yield savings account and use it as your PTO fund, don't stay just for the vacation pay.

My fiancee is a Project Manager, she has a certification called a PMP and a few others but that's the primary one required. She makes as much and some years more with her bonuses as I do, she's working remote for a company that values it's staff. I'm trying to get my young adult kids excited about this career path, it's that good. Just something to think about, it's one of those high paying jobs nobody knows about at least I sure didn't. If you're organized, an effective communicator and are task oriented you should really look into it."
,,Smoker916,,,,,"Been there, done that. Retail sucks. Try and find a job where you're not dealing with public in that capacity or having to manage employees. Your stress load will lighten dramatically! 

See if your company has some internal positions available. Buyer, trainer, auditor, ect. I wish you luck."
,,ummaycoc,,,,,Have you looked into school? Given your age demographic you might get a lot of nonstandard funding and so could spend time just enjoying learning.
,,mixmates,,,,,"I felt like that at 34. Company was looking at layoffs I volunteered and got a year‚Äôs severance package. Left America, hung out in China and after awhile took up teaching. I‚Äôve been here 15 years now. Much better off."
,,balesofhay91,,,,,"If you don‚Äôt have a lot of obligations, maybe you can look into teaching English abroad. I looked into doing that in Latin America, Costa Rica and Ecuador specifically."
,,Juicebo-x,,,,,Information technology.
,,nnikki115,,,,,"Thank you, you also!!"
,,nnikki115,,,,,"I really should, I'd hate to lose all of my vacation time and stuff starting over. Good call, time to put my big girl pants on!!"
,,ollie-tine,,,,,Keep your head up! Hopefully you kept all the cash from the Fed‚Äôs COVID gift to the mortgage industry of 2020 and 2021.

,,nnikki115,,,,,"Gold mining?! How fun!! I'm in Michigan, not much to mine here except snow for 8 months a year ü§£ü§£üò≠üò≠"
,,Overall_Seat9341,,,,,Truck driving is a great idea for a break!
,,la-wolfe,,,,,They live check to check so that might be hard. Not impossible though.
,,nnikki115,,,,,"Home depot, I could do anything home improvement or plumbing wise.  Did all training for plumbing but never left to get my apprenticeship"
,,Tyrilean,,,,,"There‚Äôs a lot of ageism in this field. If you try to enter in your late 40s, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time I‚Äôm afraid."
,,GrownManBJJ,,,,,15 year systems administrator. We get paid good but trust we have just as many stupid user/customer interactions as people who work in retail. I know because I used to do IT for a huge retail company. üòÖ
,,Particularparsnip22,,,,,IT is going to be completely run by AI in the next 5 years. A dying firld
,,the1thatdoesntex1st,,,,,"Ugh, no.  We don‚Äôt need late life noobs clogging up the IT jobs.  

Sorry, but the ship has sailed if you that old looking to get in.  Ageism is real."
,,BagHolder9001,,,,,you can always negotiate benefits when jumping ship
,,zebjr,,,,,"If you tried with the company you work for, you won't lose your vacation. The biggest hurdle is getting used to the ""9 to 5"" life and an office. If those don't work, try sales."
,,zebjr,,,,,You also would be surprised at how much vacation a lot of companies allow you to have now.
,,Juicebo-x,,,,,Don't be afraid to check into Information technology!
,,SelectionNo3078,,,,,"Comical cynical limited and dismissive of the real lives of the people in this industry and our commitment to our customers

For the record also getting divorced and paying 70% more for a shitty rental than my actual mortgage while making nothing"

,,Elegant_Tale_3929,,,,,Building or home inspector. Or even go with appraiser if the market is hot enough.
,,ummaycoc,,,,,Home inspectors seem really happy. Also you're there helping people get saved from a bad decision or helping them feel better about a big risk.
,,nowsian,,,,,"Dammit. Alright well I‚Äôm going to make a couple assumptions, married and no kids at home? You could try your hand at truck driving. I heard from others that it‚Äôs not what it used to be but there‚Äôs still money to be had and you‚Äôd get to see a lot of the world. Downside is being away from home and your loved one. Another one that is slept on..photographer. People will always want pictures of their family and such. You may also be able to break into the market of the alternative side of work if comfortable (OF). Instead of charging for the shoot, you could write up a contract for the revenue generated."
,,Juicebo-x,,,,,"Really? I've never seen that. I've always worked in small towns though. A lot of problems people talk about here, I don't experience. Ageism, being so bent on HAVING to have a degree. Maybe smaller towns have been a good thing after all."
,,Shitty_Drawers,,,,,"No, if you come on acting like a typical baby boomer and make me show you the simple basics of PC use multiple times a day, and generally suck at your job you will have a bad time.

If you come in, learn, can actually use a computer, you will have no issue. 

My company has a ton of 40 plus people who do great work and are respected. They are also usually first up for promotions to management and leadership positions due to the experience of their age as well."
,,Juicebo-x,,,,,"IT T1-T3: 5 years

,,Juicebo-x,,,,,Not when you run programs. Ffs.
,,fukitimout,,,,,!RemindMe! 5 years
,,Beneficial-Fold0623,,,,,Thanks for the info!
,,Tyrilean,,,,,"Maybe. Just overall the field is worse than others. If you've been in for awhile, you likely won't experience it a lot as you will have moved to more senior roles as you age. But most places aren't going to want to take on a 48 year old intern. They'll of course use some other excuses."
,,Zubenelgenubo,,,,,"Definitely a thing. They can't specifically exclude older people, so what I've seen them do is say they're looking for a ""digital native"" meaning someone that grew up with smart phones/hi-speed internet. Ageism without specifying an age."
,,Juicebo-x,,,,,"Had a retired aviation engineer come join our crew when I was T1 and he was a 65 year old man. He learned, and he is still there to this day. It's been Ike 8 years."

Edit: 
My mother also retired making over $85k/yr as a middle school teacher with a masters. This was about five years ago and in Sacramento where the cost of living is a lot lower than the Bay Area. Not bad for 10 months work a year (when the rest of us work 12).

Most New England states put such a big emphasis on their public school systems that of course teachers make decent money. It‚Äôs how they attract the top teaching talent. Go down south and you could make more at McDonald‚Äôs.
,,,,,,, Not true everywhere. I live in what is consistently in the top 5 ‚Äúrichest‚Äù counties in the US. I have a number of friends that are teachers. Every one of them quit their jobs if they had 2 kids. Day care for 2 kids is more than they make a year. They lose money by teaching.
,,lakas76,,,,,"Median salaries are almost always lower than average salaries as most new teachers don‚Äôt last long and the ones who have been around for a long time actually make good money.  A new teacher salary in California is around 40-50k.  A teacher with over 20 years is making over 100k.  

If you are only making what a public school teacher is making with a PhD, I‚Äôd look into getting a new job.  PhDs get hired on as senior scientists at most pharm/med device companies starting at around 100k after graduation.  At least the ones I have worked at in the past.  Probably aren‚Äôt too many of those ions around, but, corporate almost always bears public school teachers salaries."

,,Safe_Raspberry_3987,,,,,"When I compared the three offers I received as a 20+ year teaching veteran from different states, during the pandemic, Wisconsin‚Äôs cost of living ensured not only that less of a salary would be comparable to the $107K I made in OC, California but thanks to former Governor Walker who had weakened the stranglehold that teachers unions had on the collective bargaining process which allowed me, an individual teacher, to negotiate a salary that I would be comfortable with."

It did help me find project management and supply chain jobs - it set me apart from those who didn't have an MBA. However, it did not get me $100k+ jobs like PMI promised lol. My MBA was from the Big 3 universities in Los Angeles area. My issue was lack of technology skills. A lot of MBAs from my school were able to get amazing jobs as long as they graduated prior to the pandemic. The pandemic now upped the ante on job requirements with having 3-5 technology skills (i.e. Microsoft Excel, Graphic Design/Visio, SQL, Databases, Data Analytics) and made it mandatory to know both tech & business as one package deal. So MBAs who graduated in the pandemic are kind of screwed if they don't have these technology skills and if it wasn't taught in the MBA program /= So because of that, I'm switching over to public sector and just focused on paying off my debt in 10 years."

,,SuperRicktastic,,,,,"In my experience, the best pay is in Construction Project Management. I nearly broke $80,000 in my first three years. The tradeoff is you will most likely work 60-80 hours a week during construction season.

I decided to get the masters for two reasons:

1. It takes a year off my PE requirements. Because most of my experience was in construction admin, I didn't get the qualifying experience and essentially re-started the clock. I wanted to make sure I got there as quickly as possible. 
2. The structural field is leaning towards master's degrees more and more. Low-rise construction is seeing a bigger push for more comprehensive lateral design, and the energy code changes in the latest IBC are having secondary effects on structural designs. My boss tells me the old BOCA standards used to let you sheathe a house in 7/16 OSB and be done with it. Now you either have to use the IRC prescriptive method or perform a full engineered analysis if the IRC method is incompatible. 

Outside of project management, the pay range is kind of a crap-chute. I work in single family and mid-rise condos, and we trend towards the bottom. I hear tell that bridge design pays better than most. 

Honestly this is not the field to get into if you're looking to be rich. You'll be comfortable and make a living better than the average, but the big bucks are reserved for division heads, program managers, and people who can pull off running their own business."

,,jeweldnile,,,,,Lame.
,,evantom34,,,,,"Hm.

First thing I would recommend is having an open yet accountable mindset. Your career growth starts and ends with you.

It is likely that the more you put yourself in uncomfortable positions = the more you will learn. The more you learn and master = the more translatable skills you will be able to apply for new jobs (higher pay) with.

Develop relationships and ask good questions.

Why do things work the way they do? Why are things done the way they are? Is there a better way to do it?

Assuming you are new to the tech industry, I would start with the A+ and labs. Spin up a Domain controller and install Active Directory. Create users. Migrate users from group to group.

Learn what DNS, DHCP, and IP addresses are and how they‚Äôre used. Learn how ticketing systems work. Document this all on your resume and apply to jobs! 

You will be qualified for a Support role with this + an emphasis on customer service.

Once here, never stop learning, push yourself into uncomfortable situations and you will learn a lot. Look towards Net+, CCNA, MCSA, coding, powershell, or cloud services. 

Good luck!"

The work could be quite stressful and required a lot of experience to get into - but it was challenging, engaging, and fun. 

It wasn't perfect - I also tended to be the top ""oh \*\*\*\* it blew up"" person called in (I've had the joy of telling a fortune 1000 company they just wasted $3M on a project that it will never work and they should start over - and explaining to a multinational bank C-suite why their facilities management software  has functionally been down for three days.

Meeting new people all the time, networking was effortless. Which comes with its own perks. Even on days off I was either visiting other breweries or venues enjoying the scene or looking for talent. Life was good. Owner was a Grade A douche though, so I left..

2.) Working as an Electrician in the Lift Maintenance Department at a ski resort in Vermont. Money was not so great, but the perks padded the pain of living in a ski town where the price of everything was astronomical. My work vehicle was a snowmobile or snowboard in winter and a 4wheeler in Summer. Typical day in winter was arriving around 5am, hopping on a snowmobile, ripping to the top of the mountain, catching a sunrise, hit all my lifts for inspections. Chat with lifties until opening. Back to shop to fix or order parts until Radio calls came in when something went wrong. Back on a snowmobile. Climb lift towers to fix electrical issues. Snowboard in my spare time if I could fit it in. Most days were an adventure. Some days were boring when everything goes right. Funny how that works. Met some great people from all over the world. Lived in a gorgeous area that had everything to offer for an outdoorsman. 

3.) Currently working for an engineering company, running the build shop. Best money I've made yet. Basically reading electrical schematics and turning them into tangible products. Mostly building test systems for the automotive industry and some control systems for various industrial manufacturing companies. I love the work. It's not as adventurous as my previous job but it keeps the creative juices flowing. The company treats me good and it's relaxing running my own show. Working inside isn't so bad after 3 years of working outside in Vermont winters."
,,sug247,,,,,"I genuinely loved being a tech recruiter. I scouted entry level software engineering talent for a FAANG company and it felt so rewarding finding candidates that I felt would be a good fit and seeing them excel in the interview process and coaching them through everything (and being an anti-capitalist, I always did tricky math and fought tooth and nail to get them the absolute highest possible salary the compensation dept would allow). Even the candidates who didn‚Äôt even pass the first phone screen went on to be great connections of mine. A day might look like 1 hour of team meetings, 3 hours of sourcing candidates on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc, and then the rest of the day taking calls with candidates, screening candidates, following up with internal folks who needed to get back to me like the compensation team or hiring managers, etc. Super independent and I worked fully remote. It was also fun to try to not be ‚Äúthat‚Äù annoying recruiter and bust the stereotypes of irritable headhunters. I worked in this role for 12 months before the big tech layoffs over the past year and unfortunately I was affected. I‚Äôm now looking in an entirely different field now as the jobs are damn near impossible to get. I‚Äôll definitely miss it. Unfortunately as with so many jobs nowadays, I think I only got it out of sheer luck of a friend recommending me."
,,mdburn_em,,,,,"I've been with my current company for 14 years. Best job ever. Are there days I've been ready to walk out? Yep. But for the most part, I'm looking forward to going to work.

I started out as a tech support person for this small software company. Over time moved up to application support specialist. Then a senior solutions architect. Now my title is project director. I over see the technical support specialists, application support specialists and solutions architects. My job is to help them succeed in theirs.

Best job ever."
,,chicktweettweet,,,,,"I‚Äôm a motion designer and while I‚Äôd rather not be working, I enjoy what I do. The trick was to let go of being precious with deliverables and seeing work as well‚Ä¶work! Which can be hard to do as a creative.

,,Devrij68,,,,,"I'm a revenue operations manager. ""wtf is that?"" I hear you ask. 

Basically it's problem solving. My team and I are responsible for creating and maintaining smooth processes that reduce handoffs between departments, feed the right data to the right people at the right time, and automate the shit out of manual processes. We also are custodians of all of the data and analytics throughout the commercial side of the business. All in the name of making more money more efficiently and providing a better experience for our customers. 

Essentially it's an amalgamation of sales ops, Mops (marketing ops) and CSCX ops (customer support and experience).

I work with most departments in the company and feed into senior leadership as the guy who knows most of the nitt gritty on what we can and can't do operationally, and every day is different.

I talk to people and if something sucks, I make it not suck. I also admin some of our SaaS tools like Salesforce and Pardot. I plan ahead for growth so we can scale successfully and ensure new things we do don't suck as well. I get to decide what things to prioritise and do, with very few specific requests. I'm just trusted to get on with it and do a good job. 

I wear a lot of hats, and I LOVE my job. Sometimes it is quite a lot of stuff going on all at once and I would like a simpler role, but variety is the spice of life.

The best thing for me is seeing people go ""OMG I hated having to do all that shit and now I just click this button and it all happens for me"" and all the data is better and sexier.

How did I get this job? I blagged it a bit. I spent a looooong time in B2B sales so I had used Salesforce a lot and understood what made good and bad processes by dint of having to do those processes. I got into a startup doing just straight sales ops and got stuck in and learned a shitload along the way, and now that startup is a successful business with 200 staff and I've grown with it."

,,EnlightenedCorncob,,,,,"The best job I ever had was heavy equipment operator. It was just playing in the dirt with trucks and diggers, but bigger.  

I'm mostly ran a wheel loader and a tracked excavator.

I worked that job for 10 years, but I gave it up for something it didn't require travel all over the country. The pay was great, and I was genuinely excited to go to work every day. Of course, some days sucked and seemed to drag on forever, but overall, I really enjoyed it. The company I worked for was really great. They gave really great training and gave me plenty of time to become accustomed to any new pieces of equipment.

I could have found another operator job that didn't require travel, but I decided to go for a job that didn't require so much physical labor. Getting in and out of the machines all day is hard on old man's back lol"
,,Humpp_,,,,,"Worked with rigs for a few years, mostly abandoning oil & gas wells. I loved working outside 10hrs a day (M-F, sometimes Saturdays), the exercise was a perk, and all the skills & experience are relatable to other trades. The pay was also GREAT."

,,ajteitel,,,,,"I am a ""special projects analyst"". Aka a product/project manager with a pretentious title and 3/4 the pay (getting experience).

I enjoy it because it makes me think and because there isn't a typical day. Some days I'm just hammering out super complicated formulas in excel automating some process or report. Another day I'm testing new features I requested for my department. Another day I'm building a website using some jank ass HTML code with little support where I have to find workarounds to achieve my goals. Or talking with the many IT groups. Or external clients. Or just plugging people's computers in because I'm the resident young guy in an office full of non-techies. Or some combination of the above.

For example today, I compiled a record of all drug tests within the last year by type, location, and cost, created a report of all remote workers and locations in Chicago, updated/improved my automated for our department's status reports, and tested a new feature automating separation notices. Never a dull moment and everything I do can be transferred anywhere (with far better pay)"
,,hntpatrick3,,,,,"Geologist

Worked in a medical office through most of high school and college. Absolutely hated being inside all day and the monotony of every day being similar. 

Get to work outside in remote areas. Many times hiking/driving a UTV through the woods. Get to supervise drillers, log soil/rock cores, collect samples. Every day is unique and mostly exciting. Yesterday a large bird flew into an overhead power line and started two brush fires 1000‚Äô apart somehow. Luckily had an extinguisher in my truck and put them out. 

Get to voluntarily travel to sites throughout the country. Though living out of a hotel gets old after a few years.

Utility project manager.

Depends on the day but for instance one day i will go into the office around 8, plug in my computer and reply to emails, check my schedule for the day. I usually have site visits on days I go in so I'll hop in my work truck and head to the first one. I meet the customer, talk about what they are needing (we provide electrical service). I measure the distance, stake it out, take notes. I repeat this process for each site visit so I'll drive around a bit, stop by to get lunch, head back to the office once I'm done with site visits. Depending on the time I will either start designing a project at the office or go home and do it from there. On days I don't have site visits I usually work from home and design the projects. Just hop on my computer, design it, make sure I have all the needed permits and documents and send it out to construction. A lot of taking phone calls and emails. I'm usually done around 2-3 but i'll stay online until 4 answering messages. 

I went to a trade school for it. Associates degree in electrical power."
,,Ragfell,,,,,"I work as a church music director and 9/ 10 days I love it. 

A typical day for me during the school year: 

Wake up at about 6:45am, play organ for the school‚Äôs Mass, spend an hour or two doing reading/learning (I‚Ä¶happened into this job, so I don‚Äôt have much formal training and have to teach myself the finer points). 

Two hours of listening to music and score study to expand our choral music library which was completely torched by the previous administration. I came into a job with an amateur, unconfident choir and *zero* pieces of sheet music. After two years, we now have ‚Äúspecial‚Äù choral pieces for every Sunday of Advent, the Christmas season, Lent, and a good portion of Easter. 

Around noon is lunch. Typically 45 minutes.

Post-lunch, I will begin doing whatever the ‚Äúpressing‚Äù task is. On Tuesdays, that‚Äôs creating the music packets for rehearsal. On Wednesday or Thursday that‚Äôs calling people for whatever wedding or funeral coming down the pipeline. On Fridays, I usually take some time to write a short motet for my choir to help cement the stuff I spend the first part of the day learning. 

I work weekends, but get Mondays (and some Wednesdays) off, which means I get to keep my sick days and vacation days for actual vacation. During the summer when school‚Äôs out, I have a lot of flexibility and will work from home or on the road during the week if there‚Äôs no choir practice.

I got into it because a priest heard me play trumpet and forced his organist working with me‚Ä¶and then he heard me sing and had his music director hire me for her schola (chamber choir). And then he hired me to be the music director for the college ministry‚Ä¶which led to a referral to my current job. So while I have a degree in music (trumpet performance), I had zero interest or experience directing a choir before taking the job. I honestly think it‚Äôs the best thing for me now, as it engages and leveraged my ADHD brain on a very effective level."

,,smittykittytreefitty,,,,,"I work in biomedical research as a mouse colony manager/research assistant. I got into it in  not the most traditional way, since most places require a degree to be a research assistant. But I started out as an animal tech taking care of mice and rats in an ophthalmology lab about a decade ago. I mainly got the job out of luck as a classmate of mine was working on the same campus and heard about the opening. I had animal experience from growing up on a farm so they decided to take a chance on me. It was hard work as it mainly consisted of scraping cages clean and loading animal feed off of pallets, but it was consistent work and such a niche field that it seemed better than working some other minimum wage job. By being in a research setting, I was able to meet and work for a lot of influential people and eventually made a name for myself in my work ethic and interest in science. Eventually I found a PI that was willing to hire me into his lab to manage his mouse colony because of my years of experience working with lab animals.

Fast forward and now I'm in a very accomplished lab that studies genes and human disease. I now assist directly with experiments and single handedly manage a mouse colony of 2000 mice. Sounds like a lot but it's actually a very chill job. I don't have to clock in anymore and as long as I get my work done, my hours are never an issue. I spend most days just organizing data and checking in on my mice, but other days I do dissections and bench top protocols like cell isolations, or behavioral experiments. It's all very interesting, if a bit overwhelming at times since I don't have the same knowledge base as others around me. The company I work for helped pay for me to finish my degree so now even more possibilities are open to me. I feel so supported and appreciated, it's amazing. I know my end goals aren't to stay here as I want to get out of a lab and into field research, but I will be sad to leave when it's time. This is the best job I've ever had. It can be boring at times when I have nothing to do, but everything else vastly outweighs that con. And when I was working through school, having extra time for homework was perfect!"

Sure, I could have built a business for myself instead, but I get most of the perks with none of the headaches. Receptionist sets appointments for me on days I approve, office manager makes sure mundane tasks are done like filing paperwork and making sure everything has been processed or mailed correctly.

,,pllakers17,,,,,Not them but a salesperson typically works for a broker/under their oversight. Stricter licensing requirements to be a broker
,,gksozae,,,,,"A real estate broker and a real estate salesperson are both involved in the buying and selling of real estate properties, but there are some key differences between the two roles. Here's an overview:  
  
Licensing Requirements: In most jurisdictions, real estate brokers are required to have a higher level of licensing and education compared to real estate salespersons. Brokers typically need to complete additional coursework, pass a more comprehensive exam, and fulfill certain experience requirements before they can become licensed brokers. Real estate salespersons, on the other hand, often have to meet less stringent requirements to obtain their license.  
  
Authority and Responsibilities: Real estate brokers have a higher level of authority and responsibility compared to salespersons. Brokers can operate their own real estate brokerage firm or work independently, while salespersons typically work under the supervision of a licensed broker. Brokers are responsible for managing and overseeing the activities of their salespersons, ensuring legal and ethical practices, and handling complex transactions. Salespersons usually assist brokers in tasks such as marketing, showing properties, negotiating deals, and paperwork.  
  
Client Representation: Brokers generally have the ability to represent clients directly, while salespersons typically work under the supervision of a broker to represent clients. This means that brokers can enter into contractual relationships with clients, such as listing agreements or buyer representation agreements, on behalf of their brokerage firm. Salespersons usually assist in these client relationships but cannot enter into such agreements independently.  
  
Compensation: Brokers often receive a higher commission split compared to salespersons. When a real estate transaction is completed, the commission is typically shared between the broker and the salesperson involved. Since brokers have more responsibilities and typically bring in their own business, they may receive a larger portion of the commission.  
  
Career Advancement: Becoming a broker is often seen as a progression in the real estate industry. Many salespersons aspire to become brokers to gain more independence, higher earning potential, and the ability to operate their own brokerage. The additional qualifications and experience required for a broker's license allow for greater opportunities and career advancement within the real estate profession.  
  
It's important to note that the specific roles and responsibilities of real estate brokers and salespersons can vary depending on the jurisdiction and local real estate regulations. It's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the specific requirements and regulations in your area if you're considering a career in real estate.

They have just as much invested in you doing well, no company wants to go back out and find someone else for a job they just hired for.

agreed! after considering it a bit more I came to the same conclusion. I went through their entire application process which is not a quick click, so I am already invested as I took time to complete their process, then I get this email, I get excited because yes I am really trying to find my first job in a career change so naturally I am more inclined to say yes to their programme in the hopes it may lead to more. I was already hooked in with the application process, so it would be easier to get my buy in for more.

As for the selection at Dunkin' Donuts, I think you'll have plenty of options, even at 7:30 in the morning.

Also, I it would be a good idea if x, y, z‚Ä¶‚Äù
Another thing to consider is do you know if these 3 people have any food restrictions? I worked for a company that had four different centers. I started at one center, a few years later they asked me to transfer to one of the sites that needed a lot of focus, a few years after that it was the same drill at the third site. Over the years I‚Äôd gotten to know everyone who worked at the different sites through times when we had full staff meetings. But I didn‚Äôt know know them until I was working side by side with them for a little while. I brought (absolutely delicious homemade) donuts in for the 8 person staff early on in my time at the third center. Everyone was psyched, except for one woman. She could only eat plain donuts due to the fact that she had type one diabetes. So, there we all were, eating donuts at our morning staff meeting except for this sweet woman, who reassured me it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.  If it was a larger group where I just dropped a dozen or two in he break room it could have been a different story. But that wasn‚Äôt the case. You can bet that every time I got donuts after that there was always plain in the mix."

Borrowing from job descriptions is also a great way to find keywords that will be screened for in ATS software. Do not imitate exactly what's in the job descriptions; I would recommend that it's a great way to get inspired with keywords. "

,,hellahallee,,,,,Thanks so much! 
,,unfoldcareers,,,,,"It's not always necessary to explain a gap. If it's not really glaring and if it's won't be suspicious to a hiring manager, then it's probably not necessary. 

If you've been unemployed for more than 6-8 months, it might be helpful. If you have gaps of 1+ years, it may be helpful. Otherwise, you can more easily mask this by only noting year ranges for your dates instead of months."

,,rave_master555,,,,,"I have a BS in criminal justice (graduated in the summer of 2017). Kept working at a retail job that I had since 2015, and only made $10.50 an hour at most in that job (started at $8.25 an hour). Then, I got a full-time job as a per diem teacher aide making $14.50 an hour, and as a security officer making $13 an hour, during the Spring of 2018. Then, in the Fall of 2018, I was making $15 an hour as a per diem teacher aide. I was promoted to field supervisor in the summer of 2019 making $15 an hour. 

In the late Summer of 2019, I started working as a trainee for my state Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division (I was making a bit more than $42k as a start; this was my first state government job, as well as my first foot-in-the-door career job). Three years later in 2022, I was making $58k a year after step increments and cost of living raises. I was then promoted to EEO and Ethics Investigator 2 in the summer of 2022 (still working for my state DOL, but now for the HR Division). I am currently making a bit more than $62k a year. I have also started my MPA degree last year in the Fall (my employer is paying for most of it)."

,,jennifern1325,,,,,"Mine is gonna seem lame compared to the others. I had my first child at 17 and mostly just did random retail jobs and some office jobs. I have severe anxiety so not being busy I would have too much time to think and then give myself a panic attack and have to leave. This ended in me quitting a lot of jobs because I was embarrassed.

From 2008-2013 I was a stay at home mom but also unable to even leave the house by myself because I had severe anxiety, depression, agoraphobia. In 2013 I went to a mental health center for a month and learned a lot of great tools to help. 

A year later I was ready to start working. Got a part time job at Walgreens, got bored with that, got another part time job in an office with friends, and then during the summer time, my kids and I decided to get a summer bowling pass and we went bowling every single day that summer. By the end of the summer we loved bowling so much and knew all the employees and they suggested I apply to work there. I applied and instead of front desk they decided to make me a server. I was terrified, I‚Äôd never done any serving jobs, but it turned out I was actually really good at it. 2 months later I was the head weekend bartender. I worked there for 5 years. They cut my hours so that I just barely missed the qualification for health insurance. Told a customer about it and she happened to be a front end manager at Safeway. Told me if I wanted it, she‚Äôd hire me. A few months later I went into the store and talked to her and set up an interview. 

For the next year, I worked both jobs. Bartending Thursday-Saturday nights, cashiering and customer service desk most other days. I was getting burnt out and management at Safeway was sooo much better than the bowling alley. I decided to quit the bowling alley and go full time at Safeway (was at $15.79 an hour at this point, missed the tips from bartending a lot but my husband makes the majority of our money) They offered me the position of drive up and go lead ($18 an hour) and I absolutely LOVED that position. Because when I couldn‚Äôt leave the house for those 5 years, I loved that I was able to help other people get their groceries. The ICC/receiver saw something in me and decided to train me as her backup. She went on two vacations I covered for her and then she had to have surgery and was out for 2 months. Before the 2 months were up, the district manager came in and offered me a full time ICC/receiving job at another store. Took a week to think about, but I accepted. They offered to put me at journeyman wage which is $24.15 an hour here, which was a $6.15/hr raise, and only and extra 15 minute drive to the new store. 

I‚Äôve been there 3 months now and I absolutely love it. It has a set schedule 5am-1:30pm Monday-Friday. So many things to do to keep me busy, time flies by and I‚Äôm able to just pick a task (stocking shelves, organizing the back room, marking down clearance items, moving pallets around, etc to keep me distracted when I‚Äôm feeling anxious). Some gross parts of the job (broken open jars of food, garbage, etc) but all the truck drivers are super nice, I‚Äôm in the back of the store most of the time so I don‚Äôt have to deal with the cashier drama or customers. And, something I have never had in my entire life of working, weekends off and I know my schedule ahead of time, I can plan for things instead of having to request specific days off or worry about leaving early for appointments. 

While it is just a retail grocery job, I am in a union with guaranteed raises, a pension, great health insurance and a set schedule. It‚Äôs also low stress so I don‚Äôt worry about the job or the drama when I‚Äôm not at work."

Got my electrical technician degree 8 years ago, haven't pursued anything in the field until now (I was too intimidated and insecure). 

I just started my first week as a quality technician at a factory, before this I was a hotel housekeeper. It sucked the life out of me.

The aspects I love about this job is the problem solving and finding solutions, lots of hands on work, with some computer work too. I have the opportunity to branch off when I get to a higher level and pursue the electrical side of things, like working with the electrical engineers. 

I love that I finally landed a career that I can be passionate about, and it makes me want to be the best dang technician out there!"
,,smartymartyky,,,,,"I think that sometimes we get caught up in letting our career define us completely.  The thing is, you‚Äôre not always going to be perfectly happy with it.  As long as you are making enough money that allows you the time to actually do the things you love, do you really need to be 100 percent happy with work?  There will always be a thorn in your side.  There will always be a difficult co worker or something in the workspace that isn‚Äôt quite perfect.  Also a career that a 20 year would love to be doing isnt what a 40 year would love to be doing.  It‚Äôs okay to change you‚Äôre path or do something different as long as you‚Äôre doing something that can pay your bills for now.  If you want more money, be resilient and find a way to invest in yourself to do that.  I guarantee that whatever you‚Äôre life situation is, there are a 1000 other people that have done a lot more with a lot less, so why not aim to be one of those people and find resources to do what you need to do to get to whatever goal you‚Äôre looking for."

I love love love interior design but many times I love it when the architecture of the house _makes_ most of the beauty.

,,airplantparty,,,,,Hospitality Interior architect here. There are degrees and careers that specialize in just this. PM if you want.
,,research1975,,,,,"I have been an architect for 24 years, and my wife is an interior designer.  We both work in a large corporate firm, so I can speak with some knowledge about both fields.  First, architecture is a very rewarding career, and it brings together a lot of different fields of study.  I am not sure if you are in the US or not (I am in Texas), but at least in the US, it is a solid middle class professional career, and if you rise into senior levels at a larger firm, you can do very well, although this is true of rising to a leadership position of any large organization. 

As for Math and Science, architecture school uses this at a higher level generally than the professional world does.  Most math I use is spreadsheet based and is for the most part not more complex than high school algebra at most, and most is actually just arithmetic.  As far as physics, you should understand basic concepts of physics such as forces, statics, basic physical science, basic chemistry, the transfer of energy, etc.  You will not be doing complex science unless you decide to specialize in highly technical aspects of the profession such as advanced building science.  That said, you should understand what all these things mean.  If you can get B+'s in high school algebra and physics, I think you will be fine.

As far as the other aspects of the profession you mention, buildings do take time from initial design to completion.  The bigger the building and more complex, the longer it takes.  A large house may be 6 months or more in design, and take 9-18 months or more to build.  I have worked on very large high rise residential towers, corporate office buildings, and airports, they take years to complete.  I worked on an airport starting in 2015, and it just opened last year.  Smaller interiors projects may be 6-12 weeks in design and 4-6 months to complete, but none offer ""instant gratification"".

For specialization, most architecture programs as general in nature.  It requires a professional degree, either a 5 year B.Arch or a 2-3 year M.Arch after an undergrad degree.  Some masters programs may offer a focus such as historic preservation, urban design, or other areas, but the degrees for the most part allow you move into many subspecialties of the profession.  What you work on is primarily determined by the firm you work for.  If you want to work on houses, you would work for a firm that specialized in that type of project. If you want to work on hospitality projects (hotels, etc.) you would work for a firm that has a focus in that.  Some larger firms work on multiple project types.  My firm works in several market sectors (we do not do any single family houses), and some firms only focus on one or two project types.  Very small firms or sole practitioners usually only do small projects such as houses, as bigger projects take bigger teams, and thus require larger firms.

As far as interior design, (some schools also have interior architecture programs), think of that as a subspecialty of architecture.  It is important to note that ""interior decorating"" does not require any formal education or regulation.  Interior Design (again, I am speaking only about the US) requires a degree from an accredited program and formal examination and licensing.  It is much more than just picking interior finishes and furniture and can involve almost all aspects of interior spaces, design, code analysis, technical coordination, and can include subspecialties such as developing organizational design standards, workplace strategy development, construction and project management, and material and furniture development.

I work with several interior design leaders who are educated and licensed as architects, but have made a career just focusing on interiors.  I am conversely working on a large airport project where the overall project manager leading a large team of architects and interior designers is a Licensed Interior Designer, not an architect.  The education for architecture is longer and more rigorous than for interior design, as it also incorporates many of those skills.

For more info on the profession, here a few links to check out:[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/what-an-architecture-degree-is-and-how-to-become-an-architect](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/what-an-architecture-degree-is-and-how-to-become-an-architect)

,,Ruring,,,,,Thank you! Will do
,,Ruring,,,,,"Hey! First of all thank you  so so much for such a detailed response. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to read through it until now (had interviews the past week and had to get off my socials). Good to know regarding the math/physics and yes I can easily grasp the basics and can work hard to get there. And from my research and work experience so far, I would say 1-2 years for a project is still short term enough for me but anything longer than that I don‚Äôt think I can do (or who knows) so I would rather stick to residential and smaller projects if I do get the option to choose. I am between Canada and Dubai but long term I plan on being in Dubai and it‚Äôs a booming economy and demand for interior / architecture it huge there especially with clients across Saudi. But I would really love to learn a type of design that‚Äôs more prominent in places like Mexico / California / Italy / Spain etc. and bring it back to Dubai. It‚Äôll be more of a niche but there is a growing space for it currently. Also I completely understand the difference between decor, design, interior architecture and architecture thank you for pointing it out and it reconfirms what I want most (interior design or interior architecture). I think my best bet is to go to a school that provides interior architecture as a degree. I will take a look at the links you shared this week and if I have any questions do you mind if I reach out to you in private?

I guess my very general advice would be:

1. Understand basics of finance. Know how to read financials, know how to budget.
2. Be a positive force, and have a good sense of humor. 
3. Get credentials. I did it without a degree, but I don't think that's possible today.
4. Take advantage of opportunities, even if you're not sure where they're going.
5. In new situations listen and learn. Someone is going to speak first, and it doesn't need to be you.
6. Help your boss look good. Her or his success is your success.
7. Finally, and certainly, my rules in every work setting: a)  Keep your nose clean, don't get involved in work drama, b) Demonstrate your value, c) Amass influence.

IDK if any of that will help, but that's my gut reaction to your question."

,,Vigstrkr,,,,,Feed the family.  What kind of weird person willingly lets their kids go hungry?
,,Lurking1821,,,,,Maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have kids but I‚Äôve left jobs that had moral and ethically issues. I wasn‚Äôt okay work for a company that made me feel not true to myself and the way I was raised.

Unless the company actively promotes or tolerates egregious behavior there is always a gray line. Say in the course of doing business one crosses a line, like bribes etc, would you blow the whistle? Note your bonus may hinge on it. What is the limit you will tolerate? Is it a pattern? Or does the company promote or tolerate a toxic work culture. In the latter case yes it is best to stay away.

,,goldenchild1992,,,,,"Both are important but having a job to pay the bills takes priority.

Toxic work cultures are definitely a thing which eventually might lead to mental health issues and impact his ability to be present and provide for his family."

The money allowed my partner to be a stay at home parent which is what we wanted and improved our home life and happiness so much, but the new company is shit and doesn‚Äôt align with my values at all, and the culture is dreadful. I hate going to work and its tanked my motivation and confidence. That being said, I‚Äôm not about to not provide for my family. I‚Äôll keep going every damn day if it means we have a roof over our head and food in our bellies. I am trying to work myself out of that company tho and I know the only way to do that is to keep going. Even once I realized it wasn‚Äôt the place for me, which was pretty soon into starting, I just mentally told myself ‚Äúone year from now you can leave and not a second sooner.‚Äù (One year bc of the sign on bonus I accepted, not paying that back lol)."
,,micussnoh,,,,,"Your cousin is distant from you and you are not close enough to care about him in the way you are.  You are turning love into a negative thing.  I hate to see you make this more difficult on yourself than it should be for you.

This odd thing is happening for a reason, that reason might require more commitment than you are willing to muster.  Especially when you see his actions and can only think his priorities are messed up and it brings about your frustration, and fear, and anxiety.

I think you are stingy with yourself and not living your life.  Caring about someone is hard to do when you don‚Äôt show you care about them in the way that person expects to be cared for.  Caring for someone is hard because you have to alter actions, habits, and use extra energy to meet their needs.

Just the fact that he‚Äôs not caring for your feelings about his security indicate your relationship is as broken as his job priorities and housing commitments.


I‚Äôm sorry.  I hope you find a good way to listen to yourself and understand what the real situation is without harming your future closeness to your cousin."
,,They-Call-Me-Taylor,,,,,"You can't eat values. If you had time and a little bit of float money, I would certainly recommend trying to find a position somewhere that matched your values.

,,Alarmed-Solution8531,,,,,"I did turn down a great job offer once about 15 or so years ago. It was at MBNA bank‚Äôs headquarters. I had two interviews and then a working interview with a call center agent. I listened in while she handled a customer call, the man had been a customer for over a decade or something and never had a late payment. He told her he received a letter that he had received an increase in his credit line and did not want it. He had recently been laid off and did not want to get into debt. He was using his card to buy groceries for his family and using his unemployment to pay the card. Now, he wanted to keep his account, again had never been late. He just wanted to be responsible. She thanked him for being a loyal customer, told him she would transfer him to the department who could take care of his request, put him on hold, contacted the fraud department told them what was happening and they canceled his card. I‚Äôm sorry but I could not work for them, I left and went to my car and nearly cried thinking of this man who just wanted to do the right thing and was being punished for it."

,,ImpressiveSentence26,,,,,"Feeding your family and not losing your house is the most important thing!  In 2008, I stayed in a terrible job, with an abusive boss because I had a baby and a home to pay for.  The country was in a recession. So many people I knew lost their jobs and were struggling.  For 2 years I applied to different jobs that became available (few and far between) and wouldn‚Äôt even get call backs.  I hated going to work every day.

It‚Äôs real easy to throw up a hashtag and put certain flags on your company website for certain months of the year, it‚Äôs a whole other thing to actually perform said values, which most if not all fail at.

,,Taskr36,,,,,"And that's totally cool. I left a job after one day because the organization just seemed sketchy. At the time, like you, I didn't have a family to feed. 

Leaving a job for moral reasons isn't uncommon. Many do it even without having a new job lined up, although they obviously work to get a new job quickly. It's different when someone has a family to care for, has been unemployed for a while, and then starts claiming that they're turning down job offers over ""values."""

,,xch13fx,,,,,"I have a couple random thoughts/advice, in no particular order:

1. Sometimes we want something, but we aren't certain why we want it. It sounds like you want a change, you sound like you know why, but you haven't decided what it is you actually want to do. I'd start there. 
2. IT might sound like a good option, but now in 2023, there are a huge amount of remote opportunities. Basically anything that you need to sit at a computer, can be done 100% or mostly remote now a days. For IT to work, you'll be starting over at the bottom, but your age and experience would allow you to progress quickly through the tiers. 
3. You mentioned travel a few times now... maybe reach out to a few travel agencies, tell them you are interested in this line of work, give your experience, and ask them for a 30 minute call to help you assess how you could fit into their line of work. Everyone is busy, but you will never get a chance if you don't ask for it. On that topic, maybe look into Cruise lines, airlines, other kinds of travel services and look at what types of careers revolve around them. You might be surprised. 

Either way, I think you really need to set a goal for yourself. Sounds like maybe, you goal should be to determine exactly what it is you think you want to do. Research that thing, and confirm it. Once you have that, you can really start building a path to achieving it, but until you have that goal cemented, it might be difficult to know you are on the right path. 

I wish you the best of luck! 

p.s. I don't want to come across like I know everything, but I feel like I chose 'my' career early on, and it benefited me tremendously."
,,thatwas90sfun,,,,,"Education is one of the most challenging jobs to pivot out of, because you‚Äôre almost always going to have to ‚Äòstart over‚Äô in new industry. One thing to note, you are looking for a tough role: remote, training, and travel. Those roles exist, but it‚Äôs not a highly in demand job setup.

A few recommendations:

- Sales (SDR & BDR roles) offer entry level opportunities. With a few years of experience there - you‚Äôll be able to pivot towards sales/corporate training a little more easily.
- Use your network within companies to help introduce you to trainers. For example: If you have a friend or relative who works for a large company - have them introduce you to someone in training at that company for a meet and greet. Don‚Äôt push getting a role, just start to build out your network.

Hope this tracks and is potentially helpful."

I stay on at this job because I'm comfortable and if I'm being honest, I'm a little afraid of just taking the leap because I have stability right now and with all the talk of a recession, I just do not feel comfortable leaving. I also struggle because I do not have a degree and in the corporate world you really cannot move up or to another job that pays as decent as I'm making now without the degree.

Something I positive that I will add, I know it feels like you are lost in this world, but you just have to conquer that feeling and move on to bigger and better things.

Work-life balance for me has different meaning to different kinds of people. If you add a boundary between work and life, you will be just fine.   Always seek to find happiness and enjoyment outside work.   Your work will pay the bills. Weekends and Hobbies is for your self-development.

Self-development is my drive these days. It keeps me going. I am happy that I have work that can pay my bills do my job done.   I have extra money, I push it for self-development again.

On my line of work, there are two kinds of industries:  
A. Outsourcing,   B. In-house development

Outsourcing is kinda bit sketchy, on that industry. It is prone for retrenchment if there are no clients. Clients pay to make projects happen.    In-house development is more stable. The company owns the systems and they hire people to upgrade or maintain the systems internally.

In work, you must know your industry and what is your role in the micro economy.  Always seek what is stable work environment so that you can build your own self-development and in life."

,,BlitzAtk,,,,,"Hello,

First of all, thank you for this post. Second, what is the ""high paying"" range you're expecting to hear from us? I'll answer it the best what I think you are asking the question in my honest opinion, but correct me if I am wrong.  


I once managed to enter 6 figures salary range once for a little bit, but to be honest with you, it was the worst feeling that no money can buy. The mental breakdown didn't get to be with family, the corporate work lies to your face about how they value teams, collaboration, sharing ideas, getting to know one another. It's fluff really.

I reached the high 90s or just a little over the border of 100k is just enough. So many American's are struggling, and I am of the privileged rank. Should be more grateful for what we have in life because all that can go in a blink of an eye.

I hung out with close family relatives yesterday and the host of the house (I am pretty sure) he makes bank. But he also has a massive garden, koi pond, chickens, minigolf course. He built and maintain it himself over the span of 15 years. Pretty sure the stress with 15+ plus can take a toll. I am sure if you took the whole garden away from him....he would absolutely collapse in 1-3 months.

Hope this helps.

What's true is that you can fit in to lots of groups. You can find a group where you're celebrated for who you are and what you want. 

I recommend starting small because big changes usually result in big backlashes. 

Take some time to write where you are trying to ""fit in"" and not being yourself.

After a couple month‚Äôs ends under my belt and really understanding the intricacies of the department, I feel a lot better mentally than I did a month ago."
,,slNC425,,,,,No don‚Äôt quit.  Rule of thumb is it takes 12 months to be proficient and 18 to 24 to excel.  If you had mastered the role in 3 months it would be miserably boring within a year.
,,vegdeg,,,,,"We know nothing about you, so we can't really offer advice about whether you should stay or go.

The workload seems very reasonable other than 50-200 inquiries which frankly seems like a bit of bs. 200 inquiries assuming 10 minutes per would take 33 hours to answer.

Side note if you are getting that many inquiries it is time for you to categorize them and use a pareto chart - then tackle the 80%. What can be self/service, what can you get ahead of because that is absurdly wasteful.

For the rest, I am not sure what to tell ya, work is work and it frankly seems very light/manageable.

From a personal perspective, it takes time to get used to a new job, system, etc, and you will get used to the tiredness."
,,jeanier123,,,,,All of those customer inquiries are way too much for one person. I am an Accounting Administrator and I would never be able to keep up. Can you explain to your boss that another person is needed to help with the inquiries? Maybe your boss doesn't realize the actual workload.
,,cubbieco,,,,,Are you working 40 hour weeks or 60 hour weeks?  If you are doing close to 40 then yes stick it out and it will improve as you improve.  I wouldn't put up with a 60 hour week but then again I've been doing accounting for a long time.

Observe, be quite, ask thoughtful questions when you do speak & find that one person who is cool and willing to act as your mentor. You just gotta ask. They wouldn‚Äôt have hired you if they thought you couldn‚Äôt do the job, nor do they expect you to be SME at this point. What they expect is you to try & to show improvement. Just do your best.

This shows you want to be a team player, but it also lets your manager know they need to lean in and support. If they don‚Äôt provide support then prioritize the tasks that your manager wants done first, work on the other stuff only if you have bandwidth. Don‚Äôt kill yourself over the job and don‚Äôt quit, force them to readjust."
,,BosMassholeTomBrady,,,,,I used to do ar/AP and felt the same exact way when I got my first staff role.  After six months I felt much better.  I would say give another 3 months and see how you feel.  Looking back at it I'm very happy I stuck it out..... Make them fire you if they have to.  The fact that you feel overwhelmed and you know you're not living up to your own standards is a good sign for your career.
,,SMCken21,,,,,"Make an appointment with your Manager. Ask for a list of priorities and answering 200 calls a day is excessive! Do some research off work time to see what the average job duties are from other posted jobs. Also look at call center jobs and let your manager know from research what the reasonable amount of calls you can take. 
Then discuss strategies to assist you with understanding the normal time it takes to achieve certain tasks. If you are leading meetings- can you record some of them and send out- especially if it‚Äôs informative and routine type meetings. If there is an in office that you can report - I suggest you report to the office to be ‚Äúseen‚Äù in order for management to see just how much you manage.  I am a manager but I send my manager a daily task email when I log on , what I have to complete. Keep a time manager of the demands and how long it takes. Do this for one week. Then do it week 2: see if you improve on your speed. If you have a slight improvement, you will know that by repeating these tasks, you will become faster. It takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. Hang in there. Give it 1 year. Practice meditation and watch your tracking to see where the greatest stressor is - ask your manager to assist with development of your skill set. Best of luck."
,,unknown6534,,,,,"I actually disagree with a lot of these people. I‚Äôm in a very similar situation. I got a job a month ago selling cars. I‚Äôm making 70k a year right now and the guys around me make 120-180. We‚Äôre only 4 salesman so it won‚Äôt be hard to get there. This is so much money to me cause I have no school and my last job I made 3k a month. But now that I‚Äôm here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so stressed everyday. I lose sleep. I cant take lunchs or breaks. I get up at 6:30am and I get home at 8:30-9ish. I‚Äôm asking myself. What‚Äôs 100k or even 100 million if I work 14 hours a day with random days off of 1. I‚Äôm starting to come to the conclusion it‚Äôs ALREADY effecting my relationship. I‚Äôm also 20 years old‚Ä¶ will I look back and thing, man I‚Äôm so happy I had a porche, but yet lost everyone I loved, my passion and hobby‚Äôs? The point is. You‚Äôre dealing with golden handcuffs. Was just doing research on it. Truth is I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm scared to leave. Where do I go? Do I go to school? It seems you have experience. If you‚Äôre stressed, and you‚Äôre mental health is shit. Get out of there. I know it‚Äôs hard man fuck, I‚Äôm here too scared. On Reddit and spamming my friend all day. I know how you feel and I wish I got the balls to just quit like I‚Äôm telling you to do. But honestly. Money doesn‚Äôt matter when you work that much and you‚Äôre so stressed. Either go work less hours and be happy and get payed less. Or go put that stress and hours in a business that could pay 1 mil a year yanno. Idk I feel like these jobs that take you‚Äôre whole life away and you get to be ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù. Like wtf. I want to either be ok and happy. Or stressed out and lose free time making 100k a month."
,,kevroc,,,,,"Yes, you should quit."
,,glantzinggurl,,,,,sounds like way too many responsibilities.  you need an assistant for the customer inquiries alone.
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,Right now I‚Äôm making 75k which is nice. The work itself is not hard but very time consuming and very result and detail oriented. It gets overwhelming because I‚Äôm the only person doing this work while also learning the ropes of the job. And was concerned because it‚Äôs my second month. But I‚Äôm not sure if this is just stress from getting adjusted to all these new things being thrown at me
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,Thank you so much. I‚Äôm going to stick it out and try to ask as many questions as possible and learn from my managers. This is my 5th year as a professional and yet I still feel like I just graduated college sometimes. I think sometimes I forget it‚Äôs only been 2.5 months since I started
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,The inquiries can be a lot and I usually am not able to get through them all. I do as much as I can the first 2-3 hours of my day and then have to focus on other responsibilities. This is a very time consuming job which is leading to stress because there are very set deadlines.
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,I loosely let my manager know but she didn‚Äôt have much of a feedback. The expectation is that no email goes unanswered for more than 24hrs. Which can be a lot when I still have to do other duties. And since I‚Äôm the only person on my role it can be a lot. Especially since this is my second month and I‚Äôm still learning things. It was explained to me that they would revisit hiring someone else next year.
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,I‚Äôm working around 50hrs a week. Give or take depending on the workload. During end of month close I work a bit longer but I also am taking longer because I‚Äôm still getting used to the system and processes. I‚Äôm hoping those hours will decrease as I gain more knowledge
,,OrangeC_94,,,,,Thank you so much. I had a 10hr shift today and finished feeling totally overwhelmed and defeated. I still couldn‚Äôt finish my work cause I have questions but I got further than earlier today which is an improvement. I‚Äôm planning to stick it and see where it goes. I think too many new things going on at the same time got me stressed out.
,,Paid-Not-Payed-Bot,,,,,"> and get *paid* less. Or

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

,,qwinzelle75,,,,,"Is this the workload that was described to you when you accepted the job, or is this something they sprung on you? 

I think if it‚Äôs not in the job description, not conveyed to you, you could raise it as a concern before you decide to leave (I.e. if you know you‚Äôre leaning towards leaving, bring this up first because it won‚Äôt hurt to see if they can resolve it).

Otherwise, you know yourself best and what you can handle. And you more than anyone on the internet know how reasonable or unreasonable your bosses/supervisors are. If you believe you can learn the ropes and get used to it, then keep at it‚Äîit seems like a move up from what you were doing and you can learn from it to keep moving up. Even if you leave you‚Äôll have it on your resume if you stay long enough.

If you‚Äôre bosses are reasonable, you can even see what you can do to get better at it. But be careful with this part, bc if they‚Äôre not trustworthy this can be used against you. 

If you really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get better then you might want to look elsewhere.

Editing to emphasize that if you think you can do it and want to stick it out, communication is the most important thing so they know you aren‚Äôt just BAD at the job but rather need time to adjust."

3. Manifest Your Competency

4. Analyze The Ambience And Reflect Proper Body Language

5. Grooming"
,,rishabh495,,,,,"What do you do when all you see are red flags?

The interviews I get are from startup size or small companies and they have this air of unprofessional-ism about them. Maybe I am acting paranoid or I expect too much. The red flags that I have seen:

* They call during late afternoon or sometimes during the evening as late as 7pm. I wonder how late do they work there?
* They fix interviews just hours after calling me and try to force it on me by saying that it has already been scheduled.
* They give me tasks to show my ability but don't provide any templates or the parameters I would need for that assignment.
* They don't read your resume, even ask for my email id after calling me.
* The job description doesn't match my skills. Yet they call me.
* Everything on the list that OP has given.

This is what I have gone through. Am I wrong to think that some of these are red flags?

I am just not getting the interviews/calls I want. Being unemployed straight outta school is making me desperate now."

,,DrJonTam,,,,," I help people gain career clarity for my work and when you're in your 20s, this is really a common feeling that many people share. So don't worry, you're totally normal.

The best thing to do if you're not sure is to experiment and get a taste for different lines of work so you gain a deeper self-awareness of who you are, what the workforce is like, and how it's like to work with a range of personalities, cultures, and backgrounds.

Through this process, try to figure out your interest, skills, lifestyle preferences, values, and personality on top of the market trends in fields that pique your interest. Luck will play a factor too, the community you're in will matter a lot (especially if you end up in a toxic situation or meet a great mentor).

Of all of the above, your personality is probably the most important since that determines the nature of the work that you'll be doing. Even when companies hire, they hire first for ""fit"" (personality, can you get along with everyone else), then ""skill"" (can you do it), then ""experience"" (have you done it before) - in that order. 

Personality also largely affects what kind of jobs are suited for you. For example, if you're really introverted, you'll be hard-pressed in a sales role that requires constant socializing.

I have a PDF where I outline the steps on finding your ideal career. I suggest you check it out [here](https://drjontam.com/how-to-find-your-ideal-career/?utm_source=idealcareer&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=idealcareer).

,,EricaMattison,,,,,"It is common in your 20s to try out different things and not know what you want.

From there you could identify what types of qualifications to focus on developing over the next few years. The relationships you develop can help you learn about opportunities.

,,cyansus20,,,,,"Im 19 and I can relate to this. Right now I work in retail. For the most part I am shy but choose the role of cashier to see if it would help me open up more with people. To an extent it has a bit. But mostly I'd say I'm about the same just feel like I'm faking it a bit some days like trying to be a friendly chatty cashier lol. Fake it til you make it right? Lol. The important thing is to know what you want. There comes a point where you feel enough is enough. And then you want things to change so you make it happen somehow or reach for the opportunity.

 After I graduated HS I was a bit depressed, had no job and didn't go to college. My grades were good but I just felt like college was just like HS but more work. Also I felt HS was BS bc all I did was memorize everything and forget it and boom i got good grades. Later I felt so lost bc I didn't know what to study other than art which a lot of ppl say is pointless to spend college money on. I was also depressed a bit of trying to find any part time job near where I live but realizing I needed connections to get hired anywhere. Like I couldn't get a cashier job at a grocery store bc I had no experience or recommendations due to my lack of knowing ppl. So one day an opportunity to work crossed my path when my mom said her friend was working at a place that just opened...leading to my mom asking her to recommend me. The thing is I could've said no and just stayed in my room. It's not much to most people but it feels like a step in the right direction to me compared to the mental and financial state I was in last year.

So just keep your eyes and ears open for any opportunity that sounds interesting to you. What sparks you interest? Save and spend a bit on it if you have to. Even if its just a small part time thing or hobby or whatever maybe it will lead to something else. But eventually you'll get tired of being in a stagnant place and want to move forward for yourself, which is better than doing nothing. Only you can rlly decide your next step as sucky as that may sound."
,,DuxFemina22,,,,,What program are you referring to? Is it something to do with training for a career.  There are many ppl in their 20s who don‚Äôt know what they want to do. Imho our country sucks in helping ppl career explore or change careers.  My best advice is to network or do informational interviews with ppl who you see having jobs similar to what interests you. You‚Äôd be surprised how helpful ppl can be when you ask them about themselves and you are interested in What they do.  Hopefully someone else can chime in with more advice. Good luck.

The only catch  (also the reason I had see-sawed back and forth about doing this for months) was that I had to technically quit the company and be hired through a temp agency to train as a temp before the company would offer a full position. It meant giving up my protected union position and benefits that come with it. It meant facing my former coworkers who now I'd have to learn to lead who might resent my move up. It meant a decrease in pay right before a pandemic (we're considered essential but still). I was scared. It was the only way forward and up though. I'm more than capable and qualified to do the work to earn a full position. I wanted to do better, I NEEDED to be better. I was jumping from something so stable to something new but, after thinking about this move for the better part of a year, I knew I couldn't sit on my hands anymore and WAIT for good things to happen.

It's how you get the things you want, visit places you've never seen, and just survive in general.  Can you get by without money?  Sure.  Lots of people do, but most do so uncomfortably.

Your professor may not like the answer but they can blame the system, not you.  The system favors those who have money so it's not surprising when we want as much money as we can get."

,,,,,,,It‚Äôs fine.
,,sla3018,,,,,"There is a lot to unpack here. When you say ""make as much money as possible"", what does that mean to you salary wise? $50,000 per year? $500,000? $5M???  And what is the motivation behind this? 

For example, some people from impoverished families never want to experience that feeling again, and that is what motivates them. 

For others, it could actually just come down to greed. They want the fancy cars, mansions, etc....

To me, your reasons behind your desire to be financially set are what make you a shallow person or not. If your reasons are because you just want fancy stuff and a big house, then yeah... that's technically shallow. 

$50K a year can pay your rent and all your bills and give you a good life in many places, while in other places that wouldn't be nearly enough. This issue is just too nuanced to be able to say if you are a shallow person based on simply saying ""I want to make lots of money"". We need more info."

Yeah this is more about social rules rather than it being interested in making money.

Well that‚Äôs how the social rule is implemented, just don‚Äôt say it out loud.

There is nothing completely wrong with chasing money, it should be the main goal. However if you really want money, money, no single job will provide you millions, well rarely some do, just as the investment banking sector if lucky.

Just think about your job being a mini-quest to build capital to then utilise to create better income streams. It‚Äôs one way to generate more cash flow to the point where you can give up your job and move to other things.

Also think about the money to time ratio. If you have a career that pays you 200k for 80 hour weeks as apposed to 180k with 40-60 hour work weeks, you have to choose the option that best suits you and balances your life out to be sustainable."
,,theconstellinguist,,,,,"Yes, but probably not in the way you think. Money is a means to an ends. It is a method to buy things. As it is buying power, it is coveted.

It‚Äôs one thing to want all the power, another to have no plan for why you need it while there are far more worthy agents in the world going for the same money you are as a means to a specific ends they simply view money as an incidence of. It is wrong insofar as you are getting in their way if their way is planned and ethical and of high collective benefit."
What's the worst boomer career advice you've seen / what's the best career advice you've received in general about how to get a job,ov1tvf,guerillagurl19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ov1tvf/whats_the_worst_boomer_career_advice_youve_seen/,20,20,1627710939.0,
,,The1hangingchad,,,,,"Boomer advice that doesn't fly anymore: ""Find a good company and stay with them till retirement. They'll take good care of you.""

I'm 41 years old and am working at my 7th company. I've increased my salary tenfold+ since my first job in 2001, mainly by job jumping and getting an MBA. The MBA helps but raises at companies are usually pretty small and the big raises come from leaving for another opportunity.

My father worked for the same company from the day his military service ended until the day he retired. He struggled with my job jumping early on but accepted it years later as he watched my lifestyle increase."
,,emmnowa,,,,,"Worst advice-""you should call them on the phone to see if they're hiring"". It's 2021, do not make a phone call. Most job applications I've seen this year specifically tell you to not call anyways. I don't care if your uncle's boss's friend got a job by ""calling"" a Fortune 500 company, don't do it.

Best advice-really emphasize the skills you do have. IMO, the best resume is going to sound a little cheesy. Were you a cashier? You didn't ""operate the register"". You ""supported over 100 customers per day/responded to phone and in-person inquiries in a timely manner"". Make it sound fancy, even if it's not."
,,madworld_madwoman,,,,,"You shouldn‚Äôt like your job, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called work. If you liked it, it‚Äôd be called fun. 

Horrible career advice from my father. He was decently successful in his career, but he was miserable and spoke horribly about his boss, peers, and those he managed. He genuinely believed you do what you‚Äôre good at, not what makes you happy.

Life is too short to be in a career, line of work, or company that makes you miserable. You are not just your job. Find something you love that also let‚Äôs you meet your standard of living."
,,XiaXueyi,,,,,"What's your degree in and where it's from?

Try looking up those new resume formats where they put everything on 1 page and 2 columns. Since you have a good degree and seem to be doing some exciting projects right now, you should emphasise those for mileage.

An advice from my Oxford grad friend is to keep to your best 1 or 2 achievements per job experience. Of course if you feel there are more impressive things to write about, then consider putting a few more or increase the length of resume a little bit.

I'm a humble medical tech of a few years of experience but my troubleshooting experience was decent, so I used those."

,,BatmanTheBlackKnight,,,,,"The absolute worst was I remember in the 90s when we were kids and they told us:

-Stay in school

-Focus on your studies

-Get a good education

-Go to college

-Work hard

...And you'll get a good job/career and make it in life (or something similar to this result).

The best career advice I've seen about how to get a job is probably learn a trade. Unlike IT and other tech jobs, trade jobs (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, car mechanics, etc.,) can't be outsourced. And because not everybody does them, the earning potential is much higher."
,,Bfunk4real,,,,,"My dad always believed getting a job off a handshake from someone who knew you and not from interviewing was the best way. I got my bonus this year and told him what it was (he‚Äôs never proud of me, so it was like forcing him to be shocked and impressed). He said it was more than he made most years where he worked. He never gave me advice and has actually had a weird sense of competition with me. It feels very insecure from a man who wants to portray always being in control and a ‚Äústrong male‚Äù."

As soon as you can, just stop doing the PM work there.

That's not your position, and you not getting paid to do it."
,,wblack79,,,,,"Very common, why would they pay you more when they already have you doing it. Time to move on."
,,ucbal,,,,,"One thing I've learned is that the idea that ""they can't get rid of me"" is always false. They can and they will if they feel like it. I'd strongly suggest you start looking for your next gig. 

And, yeah, people get promoted for self promotion and managing up super often in my experience. It's beyond frustrating. I think it's less common in better organizations, but still happens way too often."
,,Aragona36,,,,,"I would go ahead and apply for the job. If you aren't selected, that would be the last time I would do any of the PM duties and I would not be training the person who's taking it over. I'd also be dusting off my resume."
,,jjflight,,,,,"Just for a dose of reality, many companies have policies about posting positions for some period and structured interview processes to follow for open roles even if they have candidates they think would be strong fits.  These are to ensure equal access to the role - e.g., not giving a role to one person and then quickly hearing from someone else equally or more qualified they had been interested too.  So the fact that they‚Äôre posting isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing and might just be a well intentioned process.

‚ÄúThinking about it‚Äù also isn‚Äôt necessarily a no, and many good managers and leaders will want to think on important decisions like hiring.  What I would recommend doing is bringing it up again in your next 1:1 with your manager or setting up time with the hiring manager to get their thoughts and ask for any feedback on your candidacy and where you‚Äôre strong or have development opportunities relative to what is needed in that PM role."
,,SaggingZebra,,,,,"If you're being underutilized, there is no harm in looking around for something better. Go ahead and apply for the job opening for the job you are already doing and a few outside the company. See how things shake out."
,,Heyoteyo,,,,,We almost always open up positions for people to apply even if we‚Äôre 99% sure we know who we want. It at least gives people a shot to put themselves out there and let‚Äôs us know who is interested. Maybe we go with the obvious choice now but keep someone else in mind for future positions. You can always just find somewhere else if you don‚Äôt get it. But don‚Äôt jump the gun just because they are letting other people have a chance.
,,donkeyduplex,,,,,You should apply for the job before you get worked up and start snowballing. You have not been passed up for anything.
,,RedditUsrnamesRweird,,,,,"If this happens to anyone that is actually a high value person/employee then they should IMMEDIATELY start looking for another job and then when they feel secure enough they should tell the company they want the other job or want to be compensated fairly for doing both jobs for the duration that you're doing it.  


Done in the right way - not spitefully.  


 But this is the correct move IMO based on seeing this happen for years and having had it happen. Most of our generations are raised to think we need to stay at a company for a LONG time. That's not true. If the company is toxic then secure yourself a new position elsewhere and get out. Or secure yourself a better+non-toxic position in the company but DON'T work harder than what you're paid for. Classic corporate america trick.  


Companies should pay us to want to be there. Not pay us hoping they can barely keep us happy enough until we inevitably leave. A true high value employee won't stand for that."

,,justaguyonthebus,,,,,"Apply for it once it's posted. Then move on to another company or team if you don't get it.

I think you probably did a lot of busy work or invisible work so you didn't get the recognition you deserved. Hopefully hiring into it will open your old job up to hire someone."
,,takashi-kovak,,,,,"As many mentioned, time to move on. 

It is possible that given you're not a PM today, the org is required to post an open PM position.

This isn't uncommon as it reduces bias and ensures that all PMs went thru the same vetting process. I work at FAANG, and our process to hire internal non-PM employee is same as an external PM hire. Non-PM employee has to go through the full loop of interviews and the same decision process as it would for external hires. 

Can you apply for the role?"
,,DrNukenstein,,,,,"Time to leave before the position is filled, or state in a meeting ""I've already been doing the job. I can do the job. I want the job, as I've expressed before. Now you insult me by saying you're posting the job? Either I get the job today, or you're going to have an immediate vacancy and no one qualified to fill it, today.""

If anyone says ""I'll think about it"" or ""we'll discuss it"", say ""And again, you insult me, in front of all these people? I'm out."" and leave immediately."
,,crylikeawinner,,,,,"They may have a policy in place requiring them to post the role. My company does this and the hiring manager also isn‚Äôt supposed to encourage people to apply to avoid optics of favoritism. 
When the role I have was posted, the hiring manager who also happened to be my boss, announced in our team meeting that the position was posted. That was the only communication I received from him on it. 
After applying and interviewing when he was offering the role to me he said how excited he was when he saw my application but he also had to look at other candidates because policy. 
So it may just be that."
,,NotWesternInfluence,,,,,"I‚Äôd say look for another job and also give them an ultimatum. Since you‚Äôve been doing it for a while tell them that they either start paying you for the extra workload you‚Äôve been taking on, or you just stop doing the extra work."
,,Stressedfromwork,,,,,"I am sorry, that's not fair at all. Things like this should not be allowed.

Almost the same thing happened to my friend.
My old coworker was not doing her half of the work.
9 months of paperwork piled up.

She got fired. My friend was paid overtime to clean the paperwork up and file it properly. It took several 12hr shifts.
She also learned the job along the way.

She applied and everyone, even one of the managers, thought she would get it.

At first my friend was the only one that applied. But the supervisor decided to extend the date and convinced her ""friend"" to apply. The supervisor then gave the position to her ""friend,"" who eventually got her fired."
,,PineappleHotSalsa,,,,,"Start applying to new jobs, secure one, let them know that you want that position with a salary match or your walking and will not train a new person."
,,Fionn_MacCuill,,,,,"Are you getting extra pay for doing the PM role?. 
If not stop immediately. 
Bigger fool you if you continue. 
Normally all roles have to be posted. 
You‚Äôd need to apply and go through the proper route due to HR and equal opportunities. 
They can‚Äôt just give you the job without interviewing. 
You shouldn‚Äôt have done it in the first place without a raise or being directly asked. 
This is a life lesson for you, the willing horse gets flogged and there is no loyalty. Look out for number 1. 
Agreeable people get less. 
It‚Äôs unfortunate but that‚Äôs the game. I hate it but it‚Äôs how they play it. 
Stop doing the role immediately and let the company suffer or keep doing the role and go for the job when it comes up. 
I‚Äôd never do extra work for no extra pay. It‚Äôs not a charity."
,,Ksnku,,,,,"You have to read your supervisor, and be ready to leverage your position.

 First off, never say okay and adopt a wait and see attitude. Keep pushing and having talks. Like you said, a noncommittal answer = no. Unless you know the character of management, err on the side of caution.

Second,  if it literally was impossible for them to do it without you, you should have played that hand. If you get them in a place where they can hire someone and have you advise, you lost all leverage.

Third, you've just hit the reset button. If they pass you over once, they can do it again. You also need to build a new relationship with your new boss. You can use the fact that you were a pm for the last 6 months to try and get a pm role somewhere else."
,,TheLongDarkNight4444,,,,,I don‚Äôt think I have ever met a PM that didn‚Äôt think all the other PMs were incompetent.
,,fancytowit,,,,,So kiss up to an exec.
,,builderdawg,,,,,Have you asked for the job?  The primary function of a PM is to execute a plan and get things done. If you don‚Äôt have the confidence to ask for the job you likely aren‚Äôt ready for the role. Successful managers aren‚Äôt afraid to ask for what they want.
,,cabinetsnotnow,,,,,"I was in OP's position 7 years ago and I learned this lesson the hard way. I felt that I had to prove that I could do the job by actually doing it, so that I'd have a better chance of being promoted.

,,MatchAvailable634,,,,,Why would they hire someone new if I‚Äôm already doing the job?
,,completelypositive,,,,,"I agree. I know I have invaluable skills that nobody else in my company has and those contribute to the companies success.

I also know that they were successful long before I was here and will be successful if I don't ever show up ever again. Even CEOs get replaced. Nobody is irreplaceable. You're spot on."
,,Tyrilean,,,,,"Everyone‚Äôs replaceable. But there are varying costs. Some people are very expensive to replace. 

Caveat is whether management is smart enough to know the costs ahead of time, or if they‚Äôre so arrogant and stubborn that they‚Äôd rather lose the money than ‚Äúgive in‚Äù to someone they see as beneath them."

,,wblack79,,,,,"You learned the same way I did, a rite of passage."
,,wblack79,,,,,"Because they have a budget for a new slot, now they can hire that new slot and keep you. If they hire you they basically lose that 2 for 1 they are getting. This is so common and occurs at every workplace."
,,MallFoodSucks,,,,,"Because the Manager doesn‚Äôt like you or trust you. Simple as that - why would the Manager pick you? Sounds like you don‚Äôt have a great relationship, you think poorly of her, and are unwilling to talk to her directly about it, asking your manager to fight the battle for you.

Ultimately she has a backfill HC funded and approved, and decided to go with a backfill. Just because you‚Äôre doing it now doesn‚Äôt mean she wants you specifically for that role in the future. She wants someone who she likes and agrees with, thinks like her, has experience she wants, etc. and you didn‚Äôt convince her it was you in the short time you held the interim role."
,,RedditUsrnamesRweird,,,,,They don't want you to have any bargaining power to ask for more money to do that job either and they probably know you won't do it forever without getting compensated.
,,Fionn_MacCuill,,,,,"Because they have the headcount for it and it needs to be filled. You shouldn‚Äôt have done the job. 

What you should have done is not do the job. 
Go to your manager and say will there be an opening for the PM role in due course? Fantastic I‚Äôll apply when the role comes up. 

Then apply. If you get it Negotiate the contract. Then start when you agree terms not one second before. 

In the meantime do not do extra work without extra pay. Let the company suffer until they fill the role properly.

You basically just allowed the hiring manager to be lazy and not fill the PM role faster. You were covering up the cracks and they thought ah yeah I‚Äôll let them do that until I get the position sorted. Or sometimes they‚Äôre so clueless they don‚Äôt even realise that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. 

Now you know we all had to learn üëç"
,,Fionn_MacCuill,,,,,It‚Äôs awful isn‚Äôt it?. So backward and sneaky.

,,chum-guzzler12,,,,,"Unfortunately, yes. There's nothing you can do to make her like you so don't even try because she'll be able to tell your kissing up to her. Instead, take the L, and make sure for your next opportunity that the person in charge likes you. 

If you figured out how to do the job, someone else can too. If you leave, they'll suffer temporarily. But that company was there before you showed up, and it'd still be there long after your gone."
,,econdonetired,,,,,"Yes

Long answer if she hired outside she gets you at the junior level and the senior role and she can deploy you on other work.  I‚Äôm guessing the manager doesn‚Äôt execute her own budget and most orgs at your level can‚Äôt tie individual work to dollars based income.  So you are a cost she is just trying to expand her resource pool while she can."

,,RhubarbSmooth,,,,,"/u/Grand-Philosopher145, I am glad you posted your question.  TLDR - I had to think deep about this.  Thank you again.

\>>>

I appreciate the question.  The post is two fold.  I see a lot of posts on this sub about crappy bosses and other people without direction.  I wanted to share this so that people can see change may happen when they least expect it.  Keep the good fight so they can seize it when change occurs

The boss that left would ask for project summaries so that marketing could create flyers.  That is great and needed in business.  He was a seller and made others the doers.  Some saw him as climbing over people's backs to get ahead.  I saw it as a little of both his job and his greed.  

For me, the new manager has a few years until retirement and we can have honest conversations.    I've reported to 8 different managers in 15 years....and it sounds like a lot now that I type that out.  Looking back on them:  
A - First boss, had seen a lot of bad decisions at other firms and would speak up about how efforts at other firms failed in hopes the current company could steer clear.  Nobody ever listened to him when he spoke up and he became cynical.  
B - Great person and a sounding board for work, life, and everything.  He would give advice and would admit that was from his viewpoint.  
C - Workaholic war horse that the company kept around because he brought in money.  I learned a lot of technical things from him.  I also learned his mindset was skewed and lots of bad habits.  
D - three to six month span and the company was proposing some reorg changes in the group so he would just say, ""let's see how things get planned out"" and never did work or meet with him.  
E - this is the boss that left and my first stint with him.     
F - I was henpecked after dealing with ""E"" and kept the conversation to ""this is what I have done for the client since we last met and this is what I plan to do for the client in coming weeks"".  Looking back, I could have opened up more and just didn't have trust at the time.    
G - was assigned to this boss as part of a pilot program.  Pilot ended up getting bid out and we didn't get it.  Without the pilot program, I went back to ""E"".  
E - Second stint with more of the same.  I was more guarded this round and just kept the conversation short.  
H - new manager starting this week.  Similar to ""B"".  I look forward to it.

Career Advancement  
The most important thing is understanding advancement in the company.  It's been an bewildering chase.  About a year into the job, a group of new hires went off site with a consultant and we talked about career advancement.  As HR rolled this out, the direction was for us to go back and talk with our managers about this.  I got back to Manager ""A"" and tried beginning the discussion.  After I summarized what the off site meeting was for he replied with, ""I have no clue of what you are talking about.  You might want to talk to HR.""  I called HR and they said my manager was my boss' boss.  It's a firm less than 500 people.  Not a lot of room for confusion.  Looking back, I should have seized the opportunity to talk to my boss' boss.  At the time, I was confused at how HR didn't know who my manager was.  

Manager ""B"" time was short and his general advice was keep doing what you are doing.  Manager ""C"" was a longer period and kept saying, ""in a couple years you'll be ready"".  Then I noticed that he told clients we would have the job done in a COUPLE weeks and he would retire in a COUPLE years.  This all went on for more than a couple years.  The word ""COUPLE"" had no meaning to him.

Manager ""E"" was my next endeavor.  When I asked, he never talked about advancement and always framed the conversation differently in how we can serve the client.  Fair enough.  Honestly, career advancement is like a pay raise, I'm not for sure I know how to ask.  

During my first stint with ""E"", the company reorganized and a lot of things were up in the air.  One evening I checked my e-mail and there was a conference call invite from the VP for me to be a project manager.  I was elated.  The moment had finally come!  The next morning I checked my e-mail and the invite was gone.  I checked my calendar and every e-mail folder.  Nothing!  Over the next couple years, I had a chance to talk to the other two in that invite and they remembered it.  They noted that it had been changed for some reason and there was follow up invites.  The VP never said a thing to me about it.  I wondered if I was losing my mind until I had those conversations with coworkers, .

I slumped after that last event.  Going to work was hard and excruciating.  Finally, I sat down one day and decided that I would go to work and do what was needed.  I stopped doing the social functions and fluff of the job.  I stopped asking for more work and trying to put in the extra hours.  Oddly enough, nobody said a word about the change.  Around a year later, I got invited to create a development plan.  I took notes and photos of what we wrote down on the white board.  I filed it away.  That was 5 years ago.  In reviews with my boss, he would ask about the plan.  I would let him know I had been busy or it was in progress.  He would always respond with, ""You won't be considered for promotion until it is complete.""  I just acknowledged and went on. 

Last year I was asked about my career .  I gave a short summary of the events that I just described and said that the advancement has been confusing.  I let him know if he needed something to ask just ask.  If I could do it, I would.  A few months later I got a call to be a manager to a couple employees.  I asked if another employee had been considered before me and my manager had good reason why I was a better fit.   I agreed and took on the responsibility.  I got invited to some monthly roundtable discussions for managers with employees.  The invites were for the coming meeting and not the on-going meeting.   The year ended with the typical raise and bonus information.  No change in title."

You are only a failure if you quit trying in life.  The only real problem I see in your post is how hard you are on yourself.  Cut yourself a little slack. Go get a job.  Maybe not your dream job, but something to pay the bills. Take some time to figure out your next steps and put together a plan.  If you get half way into that plan and realize, ""hey, maybe this isn't the best idea"" then change the plan.  Just don't expect to have everything figured out, that's ok.  You already realized the whole teacher thing wasn't going to work and then had the courage to admit it to yourself.  That's good.

Driving for UPS or FedEx or DHL. Office work (often very fun and rewarding if you like the company and people). 

A lot of these come with benefits and regular hours so you can then go home and do what really makes you happy for a while. Or continue your education while you work, it doesn't matter if it takes a few years. 

If you could do anything at all for a living, in your dreams, what would it be? Find that out, then find a way to do it a lttle. Then find a way to do it more. You're still pretty young and you can easily change your mind and do something else."
,,Forsaken_Traffic_183,,,,,We have a lot in common. I grew up in a very physically and mentally abusive household. I worked minimal jobs until I was 40 years old.

Chose a random career (had a friend who worked for the state and told me the most sought after position in my state). I didn't know anything about this field but just blindly went for it. I found I absolutely love this field and now make 100k+ . I never thought I'd amount to this. Just go for it! You are smarter than you give yourself credit for!!

I would not blame any of this on your childhood - however much trauma you are carrying around from it (and kudos that you left the chaos behind), I don't think it contributes much - many others have the same thought and issue.

Arguably, COVID has shown a lot of folks that a) life is short and b) you can live with a lot less then most thought.....and for some it showed just how much they depend on certain things.

Do you really know you don't like to work with kids ? Or is this just the typical first shock or doing the work and it would get better over time ? No one but you can answer that.

If you want to switch careers, think about what part of the current degree you do like and then make a gradual change and not a whole 180. Sometimes you take the same problems along, sometimes you find just different issues.

Nothing wrong with a SAM either, but be aware that getting back into it after the kid(s) is even harder.

Found a way to learn it, caught a couple lucky breaks I freely admit. But I was well older than most when I found it and started trying it.

I wasn't a failure before that. I was just carrying a lot of heavy shit that weighed me down a lot. Eventually I learned that I can to put that stuff down and walk away from it, but that's for another post.

,,Painite19,,,,,"Hello! I can relate to you. While our age is pretty different, I can assure you that I am also going through a similar situation. My other friends and all have their lives pretty much set up already. They have businesses running, they already have professional careers, and they even have a romantic partner. I, meanwhile, have zero professional experience, no business, and haven't even met someone. I did my degree in engineering, but now I've come to realize that I wanted to do a business degree, I don't have great skillsets that I can use to my advantage, I'm more of a person that's good in multiple disciplines, rather than being exceptional in one specific discipline. 

What I can tell you is that everyone progresses in life differently. I'm 100% sure that the you now is much much better than the you a year ago, you're progressing,  in your own way. There's nothing wrong with that, I have come to the realisation now that the one and only person you should compete with is the you of yesterday. Society makes us think that by a certain age you should have this, this and that but reality is, everyone is different and unique, nobody really has it all ""together"", maybe a lucky few do, but the most of us dont. It's great to set goals for your life since goals will actually make you progress, but remember that those goals should be your own goals, not goals defined by other people. You feel like you're not good at anything you can make a career out of, that's not true. I have only had experience in Writing & Marketing despite my engineering degree. I wouldn't even consider those two as professional skills since I've never really tried to craft them. And since I realised that I'm only good at them and not exceptionally talented at it, I have decided to hone those skills further, this will allow me to have a skillset that I'm talented at compared to my other skills. When it comes to my degree, I've decided to take an MBA after my study break.

The thing is, rather than drowning ourselves in negative thoughts, why not twist that and ask yourself, what can I do to achieve my goals? What can I do so that I can always continuously improve compared to the me of yesterday?  Don't care about what other people think, its your life, not theirs. Focus on yourself, not on what other people may or may not think of you. Its great that you acknowledge your feeling of not being good in anything that you can make a career out of, and since you're aware of that feeling, why not ask yourself, what can I do to be good in something that I can make a career out of? 

Don't worry. Everyone progresses differently. Remember that. What's important is that you are always improving yourself, no matter how small. A person's ability to grow and succeed is measured by how willing they are to grow and succeed, not by their surroundings. I believe that you are growing and have always been, and don't worry, you'll be successful in things that you put your heart on. 

I've also remembered this quote from somewhere, I think it was from a movie? Anyways, here's the quote ""You are feeling that you are supposed to be in another place, now imagine you could put yourself into the place where you'd want to be at, I'd bet that you'd still feel the same way. The point is, don't get so caught up in thinking about where you'd want to be that you lose sight about what you can make the most out of the current situation. ""

I wish you the best of luck!

,,TerribleTodd60,,,,,"K,

So, reading your post and response, you remind me of my wife or daughters.  My girls are teenagers and listening to them, you would think that they were disasters.  The truth is, they are spectacular people. They are good people, smart and accomplished.  I spend a lot of time enumerating that for them how they are great so they can catch a glimpse of themselves through my eyes.  They need that, because they are wearing whatever is the opposite of rose color glasses when they judge themselves, it is crazy.  My wife, the same way.  She is so hard on herself and none of it is true.  

It not only makes them unhappy, but the things they have to solve in their life are harder to deal with because they always start about mentally half defeated.  You are doing the same thing.  Strapping all these heavy negative judgements on yourself and then trying to swim.  Its harder!  

I know how you feel,  I found myself in a similar situation when I was 28.  I had found my career, sort of, but I wasn't happy with how I was doing my career.  I had worked for big companies, the government, small companies and none of it really worked out the way I wanted it to.  Eventually, I went out on my own and I love what I do now.  Truly love it. Turns out I am much happier when I get to pick my boss and can leave if I want. That was a long time ago and I'm so glad I had the courage to change course, figure out what worked for me and then do it.  

You can do that too! Figure out what you want to spend the rest of your life doing and then go out and do it.  I'm sure you are great at something, probably a lot of somethings. If you aren't sure what those are, ask your boyfriend, ask your parents, ask your friends.  They all like you for a reason and I'm sure they can tell you. Maybe it isn't ""I'm not particularly good anything"",  Maybe it's ""I'm pretty good at everything so nothing stands out more than anything else"".

Just don't be so hard on yourself.  Go consider and change your life's plan if it needs changing, don't make it harder for yourself than you it needs to be, and find the right path for you!  Good Luck!"

You can always test drive all the ideas to see what sticks, how you feel about the job and how you feel about yourself. You will figure it out, keep searching!"
,,coachzuzana,,,,,"Have you ever heard of concept of Ikigai - career path is something that you are passionate about that the world needs and you are good at and can contribute to the world. 

At the start of the career, I personally think it's good to go out and explore different things, you'd ideally like to have this one figured by the age of 25 and then hit it hard.

Now, someone mentioned, it's all about the money and I completely agreed. Money indeed rule the world - maybe you pick something that pays well and looks interesting to try and go for it.

,,N1-O,,,,,"This might be a unique perspective, but everyone has something that gets them really excited. My friend will turn her head and rattle off a lot of information about tractors when she sees one on the road. When I get a notification that the International Space Station is flying by, I take a second to stop and look out a window or go outside. I could spend hours watching preparation for a rocket launch and engineering videos on new developments in aerospace technology. Another friend of mine isn‚Äôt the most skilled artist, but he could spend hours watching animated shows and free handing clips frame by frame. He works as a concept design artist for a game company now. Everyone has something that turns their heads, and sometimes, it was something you‚Äôve been doing on the side for comfort all along, like hiking or cycling.

A change in career doesn‚Äôt come without a risk, though. No matter what you like to do, sometimes doing the thing you love can lose it‚Äôs excitement when it becomes ‚Äúwork‚Äù. My friends and I had to take extra steps to actively maintain the excitement. In my case, I‚Äôve been that with model rockets and stargazing to keep things exciting. I‚Äôm using that excitement to drive me forward, in the hope that I can get into the aerospace industry in the next few years. Now, after producing music that never really took off and graduating as a liberal studies major back in early 2019-2020, I‚Äôve decided to work on changing careers. I‚Äôm attending a community college now, and I‚Äôm on my second academic program with NASA. I already have some positions in mind when I graduate.

The best advice I can give is to ask your friends and family what makes you excited. Dedicate some more time to that activity to see if you can stick with it for more than six months. If it works out, set a goal, acknowledge the risk, and put extra time and dedication in the basic skills you need to get there. Most of us kept that excitement because we created a plan with those risks in mind and know how to work with what little we have.

If nothing resonated with you yet, the best thing you can do is look back on your life and remember the happy moments. Identify what made you happy and why, and see if there‚Äôs a new hobby in relation to a potential career to see if it‚Äôs a suitable candidate for a career change."
Friend with two Masters degrees working at dead end jobs - need advice.,j69898,ExodusPHX,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/j69898/friend_with_two_masters_degrees_working_at_dead/,19,13,1602004861.0,
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"I think sometimes there‚Äôs a misunderstanding of the practical value of degrees.  The value of his graduate degree was really to open doors and intern and gain experience while in school, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily allow you to jump above entry level unless there‚Äôs accompanying experience. That said, what industries does your friend have experience in?  What were they doing prior to the degrees and what exactly are they doing now?"
,,matt_moneytalk,,,,,"I have a ""brilliant"" friend who are in similar situation. Unfortunately, the fact that you're asking the question and not them might show they really don't have the motivation to improve their job prospects. 

If your friend reads/does audible I really enjoy ""The Defining Decade"". It has a really good section about careers that applies to analysis paralysis."
,,laseramour,,,,,"Hi, sorry for being late in the discussion. But how about career in consulting? Forget top consulting companies because it's very competitive. However, local consulting should work well too as it is quite challenging. Or try banking sector since they usually offer quite a stable outlook."
,,smalltallmedium,,,,,"I think your friend is probably scared to do something different.  Fear masquerades as many things including analysis paralysis.  If you give your friend the tips you‚Äôve gathered here and he shoots all of them down with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a great idea, but ...‚Äù or somehow he makes this overly complicated, he might be afraid.

If that happens it might be good to work with a career coach who is also a psychologist.  I did that and I was able to switch careers after 19 years in a dead end career field.  I was so ready for change that it only took 5 or 6 sessions for me to get unstuck.  It took a little while, but I got out of that field and into another.  I ultimately had to confront my fear.  I‚Äôve switched several times since then, leveraging my experience each time and learning a lot.  I am changing careers a final time as I‚Äôve finally garnered the courage to go after my dream position - which fits all aspects of my life wonderfully.

And those degrees are not wasted.  The moment he gets solid experience under his belt in whatever field he enjoys, the value of those will kick in.  He will be able to do a ton of things more easily because doors will open due to the credentials.  

Another thing, your friend has to really want change.  You can‚Äôt do this for him.  He has to be ready to take risk.  Everyone has a different internal timeline.  

On a related note, call center is typically a dead end job but if he gets promoted to lead, mentors or teaches others, starts doing more advanced escalations etc, he will gain skills that will help him elsewhere.  Really, the ball is in your friend‚Äôs court."
,,ThatProfessor3301,,,,,I wish someone had told me this 20 years ago. It‚Äôs true.
,,ExodusPHX,,,,,"Great questions. While earning his degrees he worked as a resident director on campus. Held that job for 3 years. Since then though he has unfortunately been squandering his time as a cook and now he's getting ready to start a job in a call center and I'm sitting here shaking my head so confused as to what he's doing. More than anything I just want to be able to go to him with actionable advice and say hey man giving your credentials, these particular spaces might be a good fit for you. I think he has a fear of rejection and therefore has been taking these jobs that are way below what he's capable of."
,,ExodusPHX,,,,,He's asked that question to me though. We have sat and gone through job boards but he is looking for the perfect fit And I can't get him to realize that he just needs to start building his resume out and that working as a cook or in a call center is not the way to do it. He's 31 and rapidly running out of time to start building his brand.
,,ExodusPHX,,,,,Consulting sounds really promising! Thanks for the pro tip :)
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"Me too, me too."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"To be honest that‚Äôs on him and his choices in the last few years.  Which certainly have knocked him back and getting out of the kitchen and into a call center is helpful, but I also imagine he would have some university administrative options in residential life (though difficult these days).  Depending on his office and software skills I would also literally recommend any type of coordinator role in university administration.  But this will also depends on exactly what his resume looks like and tailoring it appropriately.  He would also benefit from networking with his fellow grads or other alumni."
,,matt_moneytalk,,,,,"Ah okay, my mistake. 

If that's the case, two thoughts;

1. If the Call Center is with a Fortune 500 company this might be worthwhile since it could get his foot in the door and he could easily work his way up with his credentials.
2. Another route might be with non-profits. Local non-profit sometimes have very prestigious titles but low pay so your friend could try that route and after a while leverage that experience into a corporate leadership position."
,,ExodusPHX,,,,,This is phenomenal. Thanks for the tips! I'll approach him with these recommendations. Bless ‚≠ê
,,ExodusPHX,,,,,"Wow, great options. It's with one of the largest US based banks. I am just concerned about the potential for someone in a call center to advance within the organization. I may be completely wrong but in my experience I've seen call centers as revolving doors for people who 1) can't get a job anywhere else, or 2) need a temporary job to hold them over. If I'm seeing this wrong, I would be happy to hear that."

,,,,,,,">They OBVIOUSLY knew that the entire time. Why did they bother pushing me forward? 

Because you always hedge your bets with a fallback candidate. What if the candidate they wanted suddenly doubles their salary requirement? What if they accept a different offer in the interview stage?

It sucks, but basically, you got second place. The prize is... nothing."
,,,,,,,"That's rough but it happens.

&#x200B;

There's maybe 4 or 5 other people that went through the same thing you did. You can't take it personally. Take it as a good thing. You made it to the end of a challenging interview process that hundreds (maybe thousands) couldn't even sniff."
,,musiquescents,,,,,What a shitty feeling. It is indeed like a break up. 7 rounds seriously. Internet hugs. 
,,juliusseizure,,,,,"I once got a job because I made it deep into interviews at company A and when I told the other company B this, the recruiter B knew recruiter A and asked about me and got good feedback. I was hired."

,,OrderMyCareer,,,,,"Se......seven.....SEVEN interviews.

I think you may have dodged a bullet, ayce786. Seven interviews? SEVEN?

That company does not have their shit together. You made friendships with people but they really...really...did not have their shit together. Two interviews is more than enough to choose a qualified candidate. They led you on, because they weren't sure if the other candidate would work out, and worse they interviewed you instead of saying ""you'll hear from us in two weeks or a month""...they kept you active and interested in the job. They strung you along and wasted your time so extremely that I'd love to know this company name so I can either blacklist them, or immediately go help them change their recruitment process so it never happens again. 

Second to worst part of all of this? The candidate that they went with that they weren't sure would work, wasn't working well at first. He/she was struggling - again because their needs were not clearly laid out pre-interview even. They strung you along while they trained up the other person who was struggling. You may have hit the ground running easily. I am so, so sorry. "
,,bisgit,,,,,I just finished my 7th interview. I am worried I am being led on. Each interview takes a train ride or $40 in parking. Sucks.
,,ayce786,,,,,Yes please. Though the ice cream might get ruined by my fountain of tears.
,,gmdavis62,,,,,I once had a similar interview and their first choice (the current intern) turned them down. I got the job! You should always follow through as you don‚Äôt know what will happen. 
,,ayce786,,,,,Omg. That makes so much sense.
,,ayce786,,,,,That's true that's a good way to look at it. Hopefully next time I land the job.
,,ayce786,,,,,Thank you! I need them haha
,,ayce786,,,,,Wow that's really encouraging! 
,,ayce786,,,,,You're right! I'll try to be more positive 
,,ayce786,,,,,"Wow this is making so much sense now. I'm so annoyed by their niceness thinking about all this. They really led me to believe that they had a keen interest in me.

To top it off, on the same day I found out this guy I really liked and was talking to for almost a year took out another girl on Valentine's Day. It's like the company and him coordinated or something."
,,ayce786,,,,,"Wow, that's awful. Did they give you any idea how much longer the process would be?"
,,bisgit,,,,,Gave me nothing. I am riding this long enough to see if my other choice comes through so I can choose between them.

,,Environmental-Bar-39,,,,,"Tell them you got another offer from your interviews and that they will need to match or exceed it to keep you.

Otherwise, if honesty is too much for you to handle, tell them that you are being sentenced to prison and won't be able to work for them."
,,greengghost,,,,,"Be open and honest, say it's not personal and you're choosing what's best for you. If they were in your position and they got a better job offer than what they currently have and better benefits package they would take it. It's not sad it's just reality. 

I'm in a similar position and I was open with my boss and they RECOMMENDED I take the better job offer because they would. If it burns bridges, then the relationship wasn't as true as you thought, no one can be upset for personal growth choosing what's best for you.

That's my opinion though :)"
,,No_Sandwich6760,,,,,"Hard to burn a bridge before it's built. Company A will be just fine. Other than the interview, you have no relationship with them and should not feel guilty. Just tell them another company offered you significantly more and you can no longer accept the offer."
,,this_one_deity,,,,,I started a new job 3 weeks ago and on day 3 I received a much higher job offer as well. I did present that offer to the employer I had started and they told me they‚Äôd re-evaluate my resume and get back to me. They ended up offering a much higher position/pay rate and I stayed because they beat the offer. You never know unless you ask.
,,AlexVioletteLuther,,,,,"I'm going through the same thing! I'm supposed to start at Company A soon but I'm waiting on my offer letter from Company B. After I accept the offer from B, I'll have to wait a month before they're ready for me to fill out paperwork for them. Idk if I should work at A during that time or just spend that month doing other things."

,,youwontfindout223,,,,,"I agree be completely upfront with them about the offer, they will match it or they won‚Äôt but they will be understanding of you taking a better offer.

,,CrackityJones33,,,,,"I know folks who have been ‚Äúlaid off‚Äù in the period of signing the offer letter and starting. At the end of the day business is business. They would not think twice if they had to let you go to earn a bigger profit. Be open, be honest, and be polite and move on."

,,DR843,,,,,If it‚Äôs just about the money you could be honest and ask them to match.  I found myself in a similar situation where I accepted (and started) a job offer while interviewing for what would have been my first choice.  A couple weeks had passed so I figured I wasn‚Äôt chosen but it turned out the hiring manager was out of the country.  It was a little awkward to quit after two weeks especially where everyone was very nice.  You have to be willing to burn that bridge if the other job is way better.

,,TheOneBifi,,,,,"Don't do this. Ccompanies don't value workers and if you start like this, even if they match they'll immediately look to find another candidate to do the job for what they offered you originally (or less). You aren't an experienced member or anything.

Regarding dipping from the startup, would I just tell them via email or a phone call? Reason being is that they (the startup) didn‚Äôt even send me a laptop since their policy is byod (Bring Your Own Device). They were gonna reimburse me $1K for a laptop and that can only get me a bare bones MacBook Air, let alone a fully loaded Windows 11 Pro laptop."

,,Thppppptttt,,,,,"Please don't go this route of calling in then dipping. Unprofessional, screams of immature poor communication etc. 

Grow some balls... make a choice. There's nothing wrong with going with the better offer, but not being forthcoming about leaving not only burns the bridge. It holds them hostage from moving on and filling that slot with someone else. They may have had a second choice who they could still land for that spot. 

Communication is key... is it really that hard to say, ""Hey, I have some bittersweet news. I've been offered another position that is a more enticing experience that I'm going to take instead. I appreciate that you were willing to offer me this opportunity and I wish you all the best. Out of respect I wanted to tell you as soon as possible so you can move on and fill this role.""

Chasing your dreams and being able to reasonably provide for yourself is usually a trade off (especially in the US). Most folks try for somewhere in the middle. 

Can you just work your 9-5 and do a few passion projects on the side? Or just muddle through this corporate job for 6. or 12 months to beef up your savings account, then go back to your old gigs?"
,,RhubarbSmooth,,,,,"Yes, the source of stress changed.  I know the feeling of being in that room and just wanting out.  I'm guessing a few of the other people feel the same way if they could open up.  First, take care of anyone that reports to you.  Touch base with them and talk.  Don't let the corporate funk spread.  

I'm curious what you enjoyed about your old position?  You mention lecturer.  Now you are a 3D guru.  Would it be possible for a guru to educate people within your company?  What keeps you from starting single sessions or a string of sessions for people to learn more about 3d?"
,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"It sounds like the change in your career has had a big impact on your overall happiness and sense of fulfillment. It's important to acknowledge that it's normal to have ups and downs in any career, but it's also important to take steps to address any ongoing issues or challenges.

Explore other job opportunities. If you've given your current job a fair chance and it's still not working out, it may be time to start exploring other options. Consider what kind of work would make you happy and start looking for job openings or networking with people in those fields.

So it‚Äôs just - trying to figure it all out and not ruin what I have, because it does feel a lot like depression.  It‚Äôs a lot more complex, if I throw in the boyfriend who has untreated depression‚Äî- and it becomes more about. What is this big picture, and how much strain is a strained job and a strained home life causing.    Have a psych on board- and she pretty much said the same thing.  Give it a go. Try all the hobby things to see if things improve- but if they don‚Äôt. I may need to just live a less money centric life, and accept my mental health is more important."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,Many many roles are remote now and even ‚Äòfreelance‚Äô at production companies is really permalance. And editors or graphic designers are kept on indefinitely

,,csilverbells,,,,,"Take some intentional steps for your mental health now, in whatever way will help you.

One thought I had is that if you connect with people there a bit more, even if they‚Äôre not ‚Äúyour‚Äù people, that can help a lot.

Be curious about the people you work with. Wonder about who they are after hours, what they nerd about, what their childhoods were like.

Placing your attention on them should help you connect more naturally. Have lunch with someone from your team every day, and ask them lots of questions.

Let your weird out a little. Good luck!"
,,These_Supermarket_33,,,,,"Yah. You‚Äôre right.  I had a freelance editing gig and ‚Äúresigned‚Äù because I wanted to simplify my life by having a stable regular income, coming from a single source. I think I just didn‚Äôt realise I‚Äôd not like the work environment. So it‚Äôs a bit of a ‚Äúmy bad judgment‚Äù moment."
,,These_Supermarket_33,,,,,"Yah- I don‚Äôt directly work with anyone except one other.  So it is the weirdest dynamic. Huge corporate setting, our boss is in a different city- and we are tacked onto a larger design group who doesn‚Äôt work on our projects.  It‚Äôs cool- I‚Äôve signed up for the company marathon (I‚Äôll walk it) and doing some things. I think I am just depressed and projecting, sometimes.  Thank-you so much for your helpful input.

,,gigot45208,,,,,"I wouldn‚Äôt worry. A woman posing as if she was interested in you tried to scam you.   Maybe good to contact law enforcement and file a report so that 1) you have a record as a victim here and 2) maybe they can catch the perp (doubt it was a real person).

Say they reached out to your job.  And your job confronts you with the pic. That actually won‚Äôt happen. No employer would show you a dick  pic. And would be opening themselves up to trouble by concerning themselves with the things that you did in private. But say they did. All you have to say is ‚ÄúI met someone on line and who turned out to be a scammer.  I reported the incident to the authorities. I‚Äôm asking you not to bring this up with me again.  It brings back the trauma I want to get past.‚Äù"
,,Working4Success,,,,,"Look pal, you messed up and some lowlife got 50 bucks to get high on.  Live and learn.  So here's my advice.

1.  Institute a staunch no dick pic policy in your life.  Not only do you not have to worry about stuff like this, but the ladies find it refreshing when you advertise it.  Let them send you whatever they want.  Sorry honey, I dont send dick pics.  

2.  Stop talking about it.  Delete your socials and start new ones and give out whatever excuse you feel you need to.  You cant blackmail social accounts that dont exist anymore. 

3.  Under the unlikely circumstances that she would blackmail you with employers, simply deny.  Theres no way they can prove it but dont play until it 

Always operate with a ""fail forward mentality.""  You made a mistake.  Dont repeat it.

Something that helped me was starting really small, and just taking note of your slight preferences about anything in your life. Do you like peas? Do you like the rain, do you like driving?

,,greybitsoflife,,,,,"Hi, so I have already done a bachelor's at biomedical sciences and am now looking forward to shifting my path from research to management how can I do that? Is it even a good choice?"
,,Habitsinprogress,,,,,"I've been 26 when I started my second career.

Oh wow, that's a long time. Taking a break can definitely be helpful to gather your thoughts.

Do you have any vague idea in which direction you'd like to go? Is there a specific date when you'll run out of money?

I think it's great to take your time to figure out what to do next. But I'm also a big advocate of making a structured and well-planned move so that you don't get stressed because you're running out of cash next week..."
,,Habitsinprogress,,,,,"I honestly don't think there are any bad choices. The more important question is: is this what you really want to do? Or do you just want to do it because other people or society tell you so?

From my own experience I can tell you that it was definitely outside factors that drove me to taking the bar exam. Deep down inside I've always known that I didn't want to do that. But all my peers, lawyers, my parents and everyone else seemed to take it for granted that I'll do it. And so I just never questioned it.

So, before you make any further move, I highly recommend first getting very clear on what kind of work you'd like to do. What are your values? What kind of work do you enjoy? What would you like to be doing on a daily basis? Where do you see yourself in 5 years from now?

Answering these kind of questions will get you more clarity as to whether this is really the kind of career you're looking for.

Another thing I would recommend is to find role models. By this I mean people who are doing exactly the kind of work you'd like to do. Get in contact with them or read about their job. That also gives you a better idea if this is what you want.

In terms of how to go about it, I always recommend starting with volunteering or an internship in your desired field. This again helps you with figuring out if this is what you want to be doing and it gives you some practical experience.

After that it's all about taking your relevant existing skills, experiences and strengths and positioning yourself as the perfect fit for the position you're looking at.

Hope this helps."

,,bellamyatl,,,,,"There's a truth buried here, but if you don't have the discipline to get a good GPA at something, then what does that tell an employer? There are exceptions to every rule, but I would say that it matters less what your degree is. Your GPA matters and your experiences matter. Then, when you get into the workplace, no one cares about your GPA because they want results. That much is true. I didn't get a job in my degree field, but I was good at my degree and now I am good at something completely unrelated. There's a connection there."

,,RasaWhite,,,,,"There are soooo many design agencies, all with different vibes. Before completely changing careers, maybe try a different one?

Very generally speaking, smaller agencies will be less organized and offer less guidance, but you will have more autonomy and be given more responsibility sooner. 

Larger agencies will have more structure and provide more guidance, but the work is likely to be less varied/creative (as you are usually implementing design standards rather than creating them).

While it's impossible to know if an agency is a fit before working there, here are a couple of tactics. Follow the owner or other key leaders on LinkedIn and pay attention to their posts. Do their posts resonate with you? Also check out their Glassdoor reviews, keeping in mind disgruntled people are more likely to leave reviews so they might skew negative, but look for commonalities. 

Another way to find out if they do quality work is to check out the portfolios of the other creative staff. Huge red flag if they do *not* have public online portfolios, the best creatives I have worked with have a genuine passion for design and are constantly seeking to express/improve. These are the people you want as colleagues. 

Best wishes whatever you decide to do."
,,Chatty_Kathy_270,,,,,I have had multiple jobs where they were not forthcoming about the actual job duties. I suggest you look for another job using your design training while you stay at the current job. Continuity on your resume is critical when you are first starting out.
,,Chatty_Kathy_270,,,,,Most jobs are not as advertised.
,,scbalazs,,,,,"Design jobs are grinding out a lot of sub-par design to satisfy shitty requirements. About 2% will be creatively satisfying. Doesn‚Äôt matter where you do this.

,,Smergmerg432,,,,,Stay here until you get the next job. Analyze ways you can claim it bolstered the skills you do want to learn
,,kimchi_pan,,,,,"For your first job, the focus should be more on the process of producing the work. Fully understanding that is more important than the quality of your work, many times. There's definitely a quality bar to be met, and obviously you find it to be too low. But the quality bar actually extends to the entire process, and getting that knowledge under your belt is important. If you aren't feeling it, though, looking to another field might be the best thing to do for your overall sense of happiness. But honestly, any field you go to, it'll be more of the same, at the novice levels."
,,Dr_Edge_ATX,,,,,"Ive been working in design for like 15+ years and one nice thing about it is you can always say you were freelancing in between jobs. Nobody is going to look into seeing if every piece in your portfolio was a real project or done within the last 6 months or whatever.

I just recently got laid off and will say that getting laid off is very common fir designers because were often seen as a luxury and not a core need for a company. Which i highly disagree with but whatever. So it can be a very up and down career path. 

I think im finally able to work for myself though and finally do more design work that I want to work on and enjoy doing. But overall working in this society is tough if for creative jobs that seem ""fun"". Theyre jobs just like any other even if it starts out as a passion."

,,imsqueezed,,,,,"I feel like it‚Äôs common for people in our field to feel the way you do now. I think the next steps you can take heavily depends on what kind of design, and how much energy you have left in you to keep trying other companies (if you are still passionate about design).

,,SolidPlantJuices,,,,,"I think what‚Äôs more upsetting though is the people are awful, the work in my last job was boring and the same stuff for each campaign very often but the people made it so much better. Here I have neither of those things. If I was doing work that bettered me as a designer I‚Äôd put up with the people but when it‚Äôs giving me nothing but the experience on my cv (and shit experience at that) why am I staying? There‚Äôs nothing better in my portfolio and none of the work I do in this job would I ever put in my portfolio so to the outside world I‚Äôm not developing at all.

,,SolidPlantJuices,,,,,"I think the problem is this isn‚Äôt my first job, I‚Äôve been graduated for 2 years and had 2 design jobs, I‚Äôve had two previous in-house jobs and all though they might have been seen as an awful choice from outside I did a lot more creative work there, I started and finished whole projects and campaigns myself and most importantly had colleagues who listened to me the only problem was it was in house and if I ever want to move on to a studio or agency that‚Äôs much bigger the in house wasn‚Äôt giving me that experience that‚Äôs why I jumped ship to the studio I‚Äôm currently at but it‚Äôs surely got to be reeealllyy shit if it‚Äôs worse than the in house stuff I was previously doing"
,,wearediamonds0,,,,,"Also, keep in mind that working retail can also be awful and exhausting. I recommend doing it part time every other day, not consecutive days in a row. Pick a store where you live the product so you can also enjoy discounts on things you value. Hopefully the coworkers and managers will be fun, too. If not, definitely find a positive-coworker retail space because sometimes the customers can be miserable and take it out on you. I've done retail either full time or part time for 24 years and I seriously CANNOT stand it anymore, even for extra side money. 

This will be temporary for you probably, so enjoy and build your business on the side!!"

,,jmakioka,,,,,"I saved my old company hundreds of thousands of dollars over my 16 years there. I couldn‚Äôt get promoted to a senior position even though my expectations were the same as someone in a manager position, which is higher than senior. 
I finally left and started from scratch at a new company. I‚Äôm making 10k a year more now. Companies care that you save them money, but ultimately it‚Äôs always someone above you that gets the credit."
,,jackoneilll,,,,,The year I saved the company $10M in licensing fees was the same year they laid me off.
,,hobopwnzor,,,,,This is a resume item for your next job. But you almost never see significant bumps unless the commission is spelled out ahead of time
,,Dickasauras,,,,,Nope

,,OurTrail,,,,,"Optimized collateral usage for a department of a bank. A project my boss had been running for roughly 7 years, w/o success. Fresh from university, applied my R and Matlab skills, boss didn‚Äôt even know what that was. Saved the bank $1.5mn per year on an ongoing basis. Took me about half a year to convince treasury that my approach was superior to theirs.
Got a ‚Äûthank you‚Äú with a Smily ‚Äû:-)‚Äú NO impact on total compensation whatsoever.
Was the reason I resigned.
My boss said ‚Äûit‚Äòs hard to work with millenials, they want everything immediately‚Äú"
,,demondus,,,,,"Depending if you are happy with your pay and work load right now. If you are, then letting them know would be a plus on your resume and also boost your chance of getting higher raises come your annual review.  Who knows, might be chance at promo later.  Now, if you hate your job, just keep quiet and plug away.  Screw them."
,,clutzycook,,,,,"Some of the hospitals I worked in had a scheme where if you came up with a way to save the hospital money, they would pay you a bonus equal to a certain percentage of what you saved them."

,,JDShadow,,,,,"No, my entire job is based around improving efficiencies and negotiating new contracts with vendors to advertise money. I've never been given extra salary for saving and I've found so far 2.1 million in annualized savings."
,,wkonwtrtom,,,,,"Unless it is in your employment contract that you get compensation, above your salary, for innovative or creative ideas that reduce costs, etc., then no, you cannot expect it as if us actually a part of every employee's job already."
,,StuPodasso,,,,,Should have saved them 40k and got a 10k kickback lol.
,,generation-0,,,,,"Everyone is being really negative about this and I have no idea why. Will they give you a big bonus or instant pay bump, probably not. But this is a great thing for you to mention during your next review and help your case when asking for a raise. If you don't have annual reviews, try to get one on the agenda with your supervisor. I got my company a ppp loan that was completely forgiven. I got the biggest bonus of anyone that year (I know because I wrote the checks) and a nice raise when my review came around."
,,professorbasket,,,,,Yeh no thats not how that works
,,Ctmanx,,,,,"I gave them a way save about $125,000 a year in materials, plus harder to quantify but significant overtime. 

They brought me into a meeting with my department head and his boss who talked for a couple minutes about how much they appreciated it then handed me an envelope with a $5 coupon for the company cafeteria."
,,aj441871,,,,,"At my company your Manager may for something like this nominate you for quarterly recognition for living the ‚Äúx company‚Äù way.  You then get your name on the website and mentioned by the CEO in their quarterly town hall. You don‚Äôt get anything beyond that, not even a ham sandwich."
,,COboy74,,,,,"I‚Äôve had bosses be generous with $1000 here or there for things like that, but it‚Äôs not very common. Unfortunately."
,,CorvidGurl,,,,,"Never. I saved my company thousands every year I worked there, especially at the beginning as I dumped bad IT contracts. Hundreds of thousands over 16 years.  They sold themselves, and guess who got dumped first. The oldest IT person, and the only woman, me. Never saw dime extra, not once."
,,August_72_West,,,,,Aren't you supposed to do stuff like that as part of the job?
,,youre__,,,,,"If it‚Äôs a big company, then you‚Äôll have to find more ways to save costs before getting a reward. Or save those costs when the department is severely strapped for cash. Your reward may end up getting a promotion and that‚Äôs it. Either way, your department (the group that budgets your salary) may not ever see those cost savings because they are not the ones that are actually saving the money and the dollar amount is very low.

Depending on the type of industry you are in, you may see a reward come in less tangible ways. It depends on how the company is structured and their accounting. At a large company, $300k is a drop in the bucket and may end up costing the company more to meaningfully reward you than to reap the benefits in a way that you can feel. A very awkward situation, for sure."
,,,,,,,"Like most people have said I would guess your not gonna see anything but it is a great point to bump up your annual review and possibly annual bonus. 

I've seen companies do a special project bonus, but it was rare and not a huge amount. Every time I have seen it,it was during acquisitions where teams were running multiple processes for months.

I do work in a tech space, and while I'm not in procurement, we are constantly looking at ways to save money by sourcing different vendors.

Maybe you have one of the rare companies that will throw a few bucks your way."

,,medicine_at_midnight,,,,,"If it's your job to save them money by managing these relationships and finding better service providers, then you shouldn't expect additional money. That's what they're paying you to do.

But a bonus would be nice."
,,DrNukenstein,,,,,"No. You saved them money, which means they have more money. It doesn't mean they have more money to share with the person who saved them that money. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt (literally, I got a company t-shirt for the fortune I saved them)."
,,Lord_Shockwave007,,,,,"Here's what I've learned about being fiscally responsible when it's not usually part of my job: 

In the private industry sector, this is good. Demonstrate your worth to the company and show its viability, and you will be rewarded. But show it to the people high up on the food chain at the same time you show your direct report. Do not show it to JUST your boss or middle management. They'll steal the credit for your idea, AND you won't get shit for it. 

Speaking from experience."
,,kohanglyfe,,,,,Now your boss got a new bonus for that new car he wanted
,,GL2M,,,,,"No. Spot bonus maybe (small). Should be noted on your performance and if your eligible for bonuses annually, maybe a little bump there. You are expected to help the company succeed."
,,csamsh,,,,,"Soft dollars like that are tough.  That's just part of your job, usually.  Companies are WAY more likely to pay directly for new business in the form of a commission"
,,Fairfacts,,,,,"I am a manager so maybe different viewpoint.  We have peer / anyone can recommend / based rewards specifically for good specific items. Caps out at 2500 / year unless you get an exception then 7500.  Plus project awards (bonuses) for project execution.  Annual bonuses aren‚Äôt used much (but that‚Äôs industry specific to my industry) less so - but can be on base salary or lump sums based on annual performance reviews. 
300k / year is good for a lower level employee to drive. At director / vp it‚Äôs a normal days work and when I was at that level my minimum goal was to save at least my salary annually - but spent company money like I was spending my own (I am pretty frugal and value based). Certainly rarely saw more than 10pct of savings generated as a bonus for a specific item - although have had some big end of year bonuses in good years."
,,,,,,,[deleted]
,,ufgators83,,,,,The company should have given you some sort of bonus for saving them money.
,,,,,,,This is your job. Put it in your accomplishments on your resume.
,,LompocianLady,,,,,"As an employer I give 50% of the savings as a bonus at the end of a year for savings. It's not a company rule, and I don't save how bonuses are calculated, but those employees looking out for the company quickly realize that improvements for the business improve their bottom line, too.

Employees are already highly compensated and revceive raises."
,,ShadowCloud04,,,,,"This is just something you put in your year end review and your managers can use as reasoning for raises or promotion. I think at my previous company if you do something like saving the company a few million you would get a $100 gift card.

In the end for my role it was my job to do things the best and the most efficiently with the lowest cost. I was expected to make decisions to save the company hundreds of thousands and shouldn‚Äôt expect additional compensation for doing that."
,,Reader-xx,,,,,"I took a job as a vp of operations 13 years ago. I told the owner that if I could return my salary in 6 months 5 times over in 6 months I suggest that he fire me. Week 3 I brought him a check for $400,000 for selling older vehicles off that they would have sold to employees in the past for $10,000. The next day he dropped keys to a brand new Chevy Tahoe and an unlimited use gas card on my desk. I was told that while the company owned it that it was for all intents my car to be used for anything and the gas card too. Even if I went out of state."
,,OperationMobocracy,,,,,"Better companies offer incentive bonuses for significant cost reductions.  It‚Äôs all a little fluid as to what counts as a significant cost reduction and what the compensation should be, along with other details about the nature of the savings. 

There is a moral hazard and a perverse incentive tied to these kinds of incentive bonuses.  

The moral hazard for employees is gaming the system ‚Äî making a bad deal and then ‚Äúfixing it‚Äù next time and saving money.   Vendors can encourage this, front loading profit into the bad deal and then participating in the good deal without really losing any profit over time. 

The perverse incentive can come from negotiating bad deals which save money but do so by sacrificing something useful and undermining the company‚Äôs operations or products.  

People who say you get paid for this already forget that you‚Äôre also paying me to do nothing about bad deals and I can keep doing that.  Or I can make more bad deals"
,,terrible02s,,,,,"Not sure how being fiscally responsible would be related. But no I'm not expected to find ways for cost cutting but mgmt are too busy to see the big picture and sometimes miss the long term potential. 

300k saved in OPEX could be repurposed for something else. 

I just know after I told my manager that I said I'm sure leadership would be glad to repurpose those funds for something else.  He replied with ""like your salary "". I found it a cute response but was curious if anyone had any experience with comp after they saved money."
,,terrible02s,,,,,You and another dude that seen a payoff sound like you both work in a great place.
,,tortoiseterrapinturt,,,,,Ahh Icarus 10% might have saved you.
,,National-Fish-4094,,,,,"Nah your job is a specific set of duties. Going above and beyond that is outside your duties.

,,terrible02s,,,,,"Yes that's the thing it's not in my normal job responsibilities. Are you in the tech space?

,,terrible02s,,,,,"Yea that's what I thinking.  Great Job! That's it I wasn't expecting anything when I made the suggestion it's the fact my manager sounded like he was being cute when he said ""like your salary"".

,,terrible02s,,,,,That's pretty neat
,,terrible02s,,,,,"Yea there were a couple of people that got bonuses/promotions out of something similar that responded I guess avg white collar worker wouldn't see it. Guess it may be a position/industry thing. So the ppl that are saying a definite no aren't so definite considering some ppl benefited from that. 

If they make the decision to go with my recommendation then I will definitely post that as a bullet point in my self appraisal.

My last conversation with the manager before I made the proposal they said they are working on price comparison from the 2 vendors to see if vendor  B (my recommendation) can beat vendor A (what we currently use).  I thought about it and mentioned it to my manager on Friday aside from a 1 to 1 comparison let's think about long term.  From an overall ROI standpoint Vendor B can do what we pay for a 3rd party application to do so if we go vendor B we no longer need to pay for that 3rd party application saving $300k in licensing on an annual basis."
,,terrible02s,,,,,No not at all. At my level I don't usually see pricing only managers see pricing. Just so happens with certain people handling projects I got wind of cost since they got the quote.
,,terrible02s,,,,,Huh?
,,terrible02s,,,,,No it Is not my job to save them money.  The middle/upper mgmt make those decisions. I just know the pros and cons of the technology.
,,terrible02s,,,,,"The funny thing people keep saying for doing my job.   No portion of my job do I deal with finances, purchases, working contracts nor brokering deals.  So no it is not in my job to find the best deal for anything.  I am on the technical side and I make recommendations based on technology not cost."

,,Ember1205,,,,,"The company ""owns"" everything you create or do for them while you're employed by them."
,,gitismatt,,,,,"being fiscally responsible means you should always be trying to save the company money.  whether that's finding cost savings or negotiating better terms with vendors or picking the cheapest flight when you travel.  

in business there are only two ways to increase profit - make more money or spend less money.  as an employee, you should actively be looking to do both.  the company making more profit is in everyone's interest.

one thing this IS good for. your resume. companies like to see quantifiable results and they LOVE to see people saving money.  so you may not get a comp bump at your current but it could work in your favor for the next"
,,Background_Account69,,,,,"Nope, expect nothing. We had a team member in logistics save our company over 1mil per year in shipping fees and he thought he would get a little bonus for it. He got a Top Dog award. A certificate saying good job and lunch with the boss to SAY good job. It was pretty lame. A 1k bonus would have been cool, now he doesn‚Äôt really try to find ways to save. Just let them spend that money."
,,snarfs_regrets,,,,,Oddly enough the military has a compensation structure in place for this exact thing. It‚Äôs pretty rare to get and you have to exceed a dollar amount in savings to qualify iirc.
,,Rankine,,,,,"Something worth bringing up when discussing raises and bonuses, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to give you a cut."
,,FourthPrince-4040,,,,,First off your boss just laughed in your face. Do your job and your job only.

Don‚Äôt depend on people to do the right thing. You will be used and forgotten about. WRITE IT ALL NOW.
,,bobbyboogie69,,,,,I left after 8 years for somewhere else.
,,terrible02s,,,,,"Shows different perspectives people have that respond on here. 10% is subjective at 100k+ 10% is a 10k+ bump which is pretty decent. If you are making 125k a 10% bump brings you to $137,500 which is nothing to scoff at. At 150k 10% is 165k. At 40k a 10% is 4k bump.  

But yes if you were making 15/hr 10% would be $1.50. Of course the more you make the more those percentages mean something."

,,terrible02s,,,,,"Yes I don't expect anything nor did I recommend it with the intention of getting anything.  It just irks we keep buying tools that do the same thing and it so wasteful. Avg team member wouldnt have the balls to say anything.

,,iceyone444,,,,,"No, this is a business relationship and people should be looking for/interviewing often.

My question would be - when was the last time they had a payrise/promotion/bonus - if none of these things are available then your company will lose employees, especially good/high performing employees.

If they are key to your business then do something about it - ask them what they need to stay and if you can't help them then at least offer to be reference.

Don't freak out or get bitter - they are your employee, you don't own them and they don't owe you anything."
,,SnooPineapples6793,,,,,"No, because I‚Äôd understand what staff need. No matter what, Every staff need growth in pay or career path. If currently, there aren‚Äôt annual COLA or merit increases than 100%, I don‚Äôt blame them for looking. 

For example, an accountant starting at 60k and they have been there 5 years they should be at 70k+ and still the same duties. If they want to be a senior accountant with that salary there needs to be a path towards it."

Maybe they‚Äôre exploring new career paths. Maybe they love their job but they want a new challenge. I‚Äôve looked for new jobs for all of these reasons, and a good manager wants what‚Äôs best for their employees even if that means they won‚Äôt stay forever."
,,Separate_Parfait3084,,,,,"Yes but because most people quit managers so I would think it might be something I can and should change.  An employee quitting should not be a surprise.  If they're not paid well a manager should work to fix that.  If the work is stressful then a manager should work to make it less so.  Not everything is within a manager's ability to fix, so sometimes people will leave."
,,ObservantWon,,,,,"I‚Äôd treat it as an opportunity to see what I or the company could be doing better to retain our top employee.

,,squeaks37,,,,,"They are trying to either better themselves to find employment that gives them the ability to either make more money or will allow them to move up a ladder that puts them into higher position or to find something that better fits where they want to be in their future (fit their education or career desire) 

The other reason for someone to find alternative employment is they're are not happy for whatever reason that be.  Burnt out,  hostile employment environment with other employees or just don't like the work anymore.  

If you're able to have an open honest conversation with them, then ask them.  And if you're able to ""bribe"" them to stay (more money,  working with changing things,  ect...) make it worth it for them to stay."

I contacted upper management, explaining the possibility of losing him. Then, I sat him down, and Counter offered without knowing if he had one or not. He decided to take may offer and stay with me. I genuinely think that if you're in the ""best employee"" situation, you should approach your boss and discuss the situation. Would you stay if they make you an offer?

The only thing you should do is determine if there‚Äôs anything you can do to keep them around, be it better pay, more flexibility, more rewarding assignments or whatever. If there‚Äôs nothing you can do or will consider, well that‚Äôs probably exactly why they‚Äôre looking around"
,,Introduction_Deep,,,,,"It really depends. Yeah, I'd be upset. I like my best workers and do whatever i can for them. Good employees are gold. However, they're people and friends too. If they find a better opportunity than I can offer, I wish them well."

If I can‚Äôt offer that (which mostly I can‚Äôt because there is no where to really go) then I obviously understand why they would need to move on. I would definitely see if there is anything I can do to keep them. Everyone is replaceable - even the best of the best.

I hope I'm giving them the skills they need to move forward in life. But honestly, I know I'm weird."
,,smartymartyky,,,,,Not really.  It means you developed them to search for something better.  Do you want to keep on as an employee?  Then you‚Äôre going to have to offer more incentive to keep them.  Losing a good employee can cost you in the long run.

,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,"That‚Äôs la la land, 25% yoy increase is not a thing"
,,MTYAUG,,,,,So you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre a shitty manager?
,,MTYAUG,,,,,Not bothered enough to do something to keep them?
,,MTYAUG,,,,,So you‚Äôre admitting you‚Äôre a shitty manager?
,,blny99,,,,,Not always.  There are bad companies with some good managers.  Sometimes the manager too dreams of leaving for a better company when he realizes he can‚Äôt change certain things above him.
,,UAlogang,,,,,"I think there is some truth to the whole ‚Äúpeople leave managers not companies‚Äù thing, but I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs ironclad. In the worst case, it‚Äôs propaganda generated by whoever decided the pay and benefits packages to make front line managers feel bad for not keeping good employees at below-market wages."
,,raadim,,,,,"I left a company, not a manager. My boss was not perfect but he was ok. The company was just sh.t. I actually never even applied for a job there. The company I was working for was acquired by another company and all went sideways. When I resigned, my boss tried to offer me more money. I told him it‚Äôs not that. I would probably even accept a small pay cut somewhere else just to leave that place."
,,redditgambino,,,,,Of course people are going to go for what‚Äôs best for them. Managers should not expect employees to be loyal to their managers or the company just like the company (an most managers) would not be loyal to them if push came to shove. It‚Äôs just business.
,,,,,,,Not when your employee moves on mid-year they‚Äôre not üòÇ
,,syonxwf,,,,,"Is that something within your control to offer? I assume if they‚Äôre looking for a new role that offers WFH, your employee can likely do their work remotely. If it‚Äôs not something you can offer, be prepared to lose them regardless of what else is offered. Might not be immediately if a large enough raise is offered, but eventually that bug will bite again and you‚Äôll be in the same predicament later."
,,tamponinja,,,,,Then offer remote.
,,codemise,,,,,"Oh, it definitely bothers me."
,,Sandmsounds,,,,,Well expect it either way. People grow up and move on if they‚Äôre not seeing growth from a job.
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"That's why they're looking, though. 25% increase is common when moving companies."
,,texag2014-1,,,,,I‚Äôve consistently gotten 8-12% raises every year since 2016. At some point I assume this will stop but we‚Äôre into the upper 100s at this point.
,,Aragona36,,,,,Did you read my comment?
,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,Sometimes you can‚Äôt
,,xch13fx,,,,,"That's a bit too negative of mindset in my opinion. I stated I would be bothered I'd be losing my best person, not that I wouldn't try to stop it. The point is, when someone gets to that point, it's almost always too little, too late. It's often not the managers fault a situation is what it is either, so they often aren't super capable of 'fixing' anything. My overall message, is that the manager wouldn't be upset at the employee, rather the situation, and hopefully they'll learn from it and take action before it becomes an issue."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,What makes you say that? You're happy for the person when they leave. I'm allowed to be bothered if I'm losing a good person and have to hire & train someone new. Those things arent mutually exclusive.
,,justsomeguy32,,,,,"So yes, you're absolutely right. Those things can make a difference. Direct manager is the biggest single factor though and that was what was relevant to the question as asked."
,,justsomeguy32,,,,,"Ya, dissecting this will come down to who you trust for sure. Gallop's book 'First, Break All The Rules' makes a compelling, evidence based case for the position that managers are the single biggest factor for employee engagement. I recommend the book for current and prospective managers."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"So you WOULD be bothered in this scenario. You're not upset at the employee obviously, but you are bothered."
,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,"And that‚Äôs perfectly fine, I‚Äôve done this number of times myself"
,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,"Sure it is, it also comes with other issues, but I agree, changing jobs will get you those increases to a point, once you cross 400-500k a year, it‚Äôs only RSUs/stock options that matter"
,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,"Ate you over 500k? Even a bit beyond that, you‚Äôre lucky, at some point salary becomes something to sustain you"
,,MTYAUG,,,,,Did you miss the point of the question? As a manager I would try to find away to keep them by understanding why they‚Äôre looking elsewhere and attempt to meet those desires. If I couldn‚Äôt I would be happy for my best employees to be moving on to better opportunities than I could offer. I would never be bothered by them trying to find something that I can‚Äôt provide like you are.
,,MTYAUG,,,,,That should be much more bothersome.
,,MTYAUG,,,,,As a manager I would try to find away to keep them by understanding why they‚Äôre looking elsewhere and attempt to meet those desires. If I couldn‚Äôt I would be happy for my best employees to be moving on to better opportunities than I could offer. I would never be bothered by them trying to find something that I can‚Äôt provide like you are.
,,UAlogang,,,,,"I haven‚Äôt read that book, but I probably should. However, I have left positions because, as much as I liked and respected my manager, they couldn‚Äôt get me appropriate pay raises, and I know plenty of people who‚Äôve done the same. Anecdotes aren‚Äôt data, for sure, I‚Äôm just saying there‚Äôs times when leaving a good manager is necessary for career progression."
,,codemise,,,,,I am bothered that my company doesn't value a good employee. That was not the question posed by OP.
,,Aragona36,,,,,"Ok let me translate my answer since you are struggling. Would I be bothered? My response, yes. Obviously I would because this is apparently my best employee. Of course I would be bothered. Second part of the question, looking at other job postings. My response, but they have a right to do that, so put it together. Yes, I would be bothered that my best employee was looking at jobs but they do have a right to look for other jobs. My apologies, I didn‚Äôt realize my response was so complex."
,,DarkMatter-Forever,,,,,"Sure, but sometimes you just can‚Äôt. I manage almost 60 people, but it‚Äôs not always possible even though I fight for each person"
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"I guess you arent bothered when bad things happen to your team. Your best employee leaving is a detriment, no? That should bother you. 

Again, this is not mutually exclusive. You can still be exceedingly happy for your best employee to move on, frankly you should expect it. You're still allowed to be upset that theyll leave a void you now need to fill. Feeling more than one thing at a time is allowed."
,,justsomeguy32,,,,,Totally agree that there are more factors than just the immediate manager.
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,Is it not?
,,MTYAUG,,,,,"Would I be bothered by my inability to properly manage my team? Absolutely. People don't leave bad jobs. They leave because of bad bosses, poor management, who don't appreciate their value."
,,OmNomCakes,,,,,Not even close.
,,codemise,,,,,No. The question is quite clear to the average reader with basic reading comprehension.
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"You're clearly not a manager. Managers arent given free reign, there're things like budgets and approvals and headcount growth, all outside of your control.. those limitations lead to employee dissatisfaction that you cant manage your way out of. In some cases you're actually HOPING that your best people are looking and find something new, they deserve it. And when they do leave it'll bother you that you now need to backfill all that great work theyve been doing for you."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"Really? As a manager, would you be bothered? Nothing to do with why you're bothered, what's bothering you, etc.."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,I dont know why the average reader would assume this wasnt written by a manager.
,,MTYAUG,,,,,Lol I‚Äôm a manager of a sales team at a fortune 100 company but go on and tell me more about how ineffective you are at literally managing your employees. My leader listens to me when I say hey we need to consider some additional resources to keep x employee bc they‚Äôre looking elsewhere. The only thing I would ‚Äúbothered‚Äù by if they left was my ineptitude. Stop being so sensitive and be a better leader to your people.
,,OmNomCakes,,,,,"The person is asking if the manager would be upset towards the employee, ie hostile, if they found out said employee was looking for a new job. Period. Your reply is contextless so I've no idea what you were trying to say. :c"
,,codemise,,,,,The meaning can be derived from the context alone. The job role of the individual is irrelevant.
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,Riiiiight
,,mr_teriyaki_,,,,,"Yikes, what a neckbeard. Reddit is hiring if you want a power trip neckbeard job where you can yell at internet strangers all the time."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"The person didnt ask that. They couldve easily asked ""will my manager be upset with me if they find out I'm looking?"". That's not what they wrote, though.."
,,OmNomCakes,,,,,"They did. That is what the context they used means. Without further iterative context the focus is placed on the subject (employee) , not on an imaginary circumstance or third party (the company)."
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,"This exact question couldve been posed by a manager, perhaps wondering if their feelings were justified or not. You're the one that's making assumptions about OPs question. The fact is theres very little context in their question."
,,OmNomCakes,,,,,"That's what's great about context! No matter what party posted the question the context is still exactly the same! It's almost as if it was a language of sorts with defined rules and structure. 

But it's okay if you don't understand. Maybe one day. Good luck person!"
,,FuturePerformance,,,,,You're not as smart as you think you are!
,,OmNomCakes,,,,,That's okay! Have a good one <3

How to move after being fired?,15tnn6u,RetroNight,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/15tnn6u/how_to_move_after_being_fired/,13,38,1692278880.0,
,,No-Professional-1884,,,,,I wouldn‚Äôt. I would just leave it as ‚Äúnot a good fit‚Äù and if pressed say ‚Äúthat is as specific as I‚Äôd like to be.‚Äù
,,spectredirector,,,,,"The answer to the question is ALWAYS:
 
***I thought it was time to pursue new challenges. I saw little opportunity to continue moving up at my previous position.***
 
If they ask why you did that without a new job lined up, the answer is: 
 
***It was time for me to move on***
 
You say that in a tone in which the interviewer can read whatever they need to out of the statement. It comes off as not trying to bad mouth a previous employer, which is a thing a new employer is looking for. More importantly, it's a short terse statement that says - *move on* - to the interviewer.
 
Nothing about the above is a lie. It all meets the HR people's need -- you weren't fired for being a menace, nor were you fired for incompetence at the gig.
 
You learned a personal lesson from your termination. There is zero reason to be transparent with any interviewer, you need to be honest -- not transparent. Don't offer anything critical of yourself, the new job won't know the conditions of termination without you telling them. You telling them will be a significant black mark likely disqualifying out of hand by some employers."
,,Inkdrunnergirl,,,,,"THERE IS NO STATE OR FED LAW AGAINST GIVING A TRUE BAD REFERENCE. ZERO. 

I really wish people would stop. Companies don‚Äôt because of potential legal hassle but if it‚Äôs true and accurate they can say whatever they want. [Is It Illegal To Give A Bad Reference?](https://www.gclawoffice.com/is-it-illegal-to-give-a-bad-reference/)"
,,Richard-Roma-92,,,,,"Contrarian opinion: use it as a opportunity to show growth. 

I know you‚Äôre in FL and politically it‚Äôs unpopular - but take an online DEI course (https://www.edapp.com/ is a good inexpensive one) and when they ask you why you left your other company say:

‚ÄúI was joking around with colleagues one day like always and only months later I was told one of my jokes that day was determined by HR to be inappropriate.

I was dumbfounded because during my entire scholastic and professional career I have always believe in equality and treating everyone the same at work. 

After conversations with HR, it was determined I would leave the company. I was initially angry about all of this - it felt very unfair. However soon afterward I decided to attend a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion course to find out how I could have been wrong about what I said. And it was then the scales fell from my eyes. 

Since then I‚Äôve become so much more empathetic to my teammates life experience - I know we are told form early ages to think before speaking, but now I really do. I think about the person I‚Äôm speaking to and about the people who may hear what I am saying within earshot and those who will hear what I‚Äôve said delivered (and sometimes interpreted) by other people second hand. 

And when I make mistakes - I‚Äôm only human - I now try to understand and empathize and apologize quickly - especially when I still may feel my comments were ‚Äúfine.‚Äù

Because I learned I don‚Äôt get to decide how I make other people feel.

All and all it was a hard experience but I believe it made me a better person and a much better and more valuable co-worker to my team.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs my advice - meet it head on. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll always be worried about the reference or background check even if you get past the interviews. I‚Äôve seen references who promised a good reference talk about this type of stuff and torpedoing a candidate because the candidate will never know. 

The only thing better than saying all this is to believe it. When someone says we hurt them, we don‚Äôt get to say ‚Äúno we didn‚Äôt.‚Äù That‚Äôs really all it‚Äôs about."
,,Ok_Tale7071,,,,,"They can only confirm the dates you worked there.  
Just say after 5 years, it was time for a new challenge."
,,CapUmFatEars,,,,,"Well now you know, you can‚Äôt say shit in the workplace without offending someone but even if they‚Äôre not offended they will use it as an opportunity to get you cancelled and get one other person out of their way. If you want a friend you really do need to buy a dog. So next job, you‚Äôll never do that shit again so put it behind you and move on. 

In the interview‚Ä¶.never, ever, ever bring it up or say you did this or that or farted or whatever. Don‚Äôt go there. Act like it never happened. Because the interview isn‚Äôt for you to bear your soul and snivel about every little shitty thing you‚Äôve done in the past. That will just guarantee you will be shown the door and not get a job offer.

The interview is really a sales presentation. You are the sales person and the interviewer is the buyer. You are the product. You are trying to sell yourself. Convince the buyer that you are the best person for the job. You do that by knowing the requirements for the job and sell them on how great you can do at meeting those requirements. Your goal is to get an offer. The interviewer‚Äôs goal is to find the best person who can do the job effectively and will be committed so they won‚Äôt have to interview again in 6 months. The last thing they want is some goofball who can‚Äôt navigate office politics and is saying stupid shit in the form of ‚Äòjokes‚Äô that will get them fired. 

Be the opposite of that, convince the buyer and get an offer. Don‚Äôt lie but don‚Äôt provide information that they aren‚Äôt asking about. You have to act. 

If you convince them to hire you the background check is a formality assuming no criminal convictions. If they even do contact your prior employer which is iffy, usually they will only disclose the dates you worked there and maybe your salary. Their lawyers have told them not to disclose much more than that so they won‚Äôt get sued and canceled. It‚Äôs a fucked up world but use it as an advantage not as a detriment.

It‚Äôs all just one big fucking game. If you know the rules of that game you can‚Äôt lose because believe me the bar is very low. Most people interview like complete shit. If a bear is chasing you and another guy, you don‚Äôt have to run faster than the bear just faster than the other guy. And usually in an interview, the other is slow and stepping all over it in there. Good luck."
,,catchmesleeping,,,,,I was let go because my values and theirs didn‚Äôt align.
,,imnotabotareyou,,,,,What was the joke?
,,jasikanicolepi,,,,,Give generic answer or a non-answer.
,,Admirable-Speed7914,,,,,"Tell the new prospective employer you are grateful for many things from the past employer

Do not bring up the negative
Which would be the equivalent of attempting to date someone after you told them you had a stalking change against you. Leave it behind"
,,Won_who_wonders,,,,,"I know multiple HR reps and both corporate America and small businesses, and legally they cannot ask a company if or why you were let go. However, the way they get around this is wood they rehire you later down the road. If the answer is no, then that is the legal way of telling the potential employer that you were let go."
,,Won_who_wonders,,,,,"Keep it positive.  Never, I repeat, never talk negatively about your previous employer, manager, etc.  If you openly speak negatively about them, that speaks volumes about your character and no one wants a negative person on their team."
,,Imlooloo,,,,,Well are we going to hear the joke that got your fired or what? Live and learn and move on. But first the joke kind sir‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
,,Horse4me2,,,,,"You need a coach on this one.I‚Äôm not hearing that you really understand what you did or see it as the serious issue it was.  Hire a work/new job coach & work with them on the issue, updating your resume, and how to best handle the firing on an interview.  You can move on successfully from this."

,,RetroNight,,,,,"Thank you for your advice.

I figured if they ask, I can just say I resigned with a notice. Just not sure what companies may validate this or overly question it."
,,CapUmFatEars,,,,,"Spot on, mate."
,,Richard-Roma-92,,,,,"I can't imagine someone who thought that their coworkers got together and group-reported their behavior wouldn't think that any reference at that company wouldn't ""tell the truth"" on the sly. 

I've called references and heard from people similar stories. References i was assured by the candidate were golden. And once I call, they whisper ""can I be honest with you...?"" 

And I've never told candidates I've passed on then because of what their references said. And honestly, if they were so ""out of it"" that they didn't know this ""golden reference"" would take the first opportunity to out the candidates problematic behavior, that person doesn't have the skills I need them to have."
,,_jetrun,,,,,"I understand the philosophy behind your suggestion, and there is some merit behind meeting it ""head on"". But if you're going to have OP take this route, why are you asking him to lie? OP seems genuinely distraught about the situation and they aren't making any excuses. Why pretend that they learned their lesson after some DEI course? And then lie to a prospective employer about it?"
,,CapUmFatEars,,,,,Absolutely horrible advice. Just terrible. No interviewer wants to hear this drivel. He‚Äôll get disqualified just on the grounds of being annoying as fuck let alone that he just disclosed he‚Äôs a fucking psycho. Seriously? Oh Good Gawd!
,,RetroNight,,,,,Guess that means I should make the next employer aware I got let go? I don't know what the right answer is. People are giving very mixed answers.
,,CapUmFatEars,,,,,He doesn‚Äôt need a fucking coach or torture himself  further with alot of soul searching nonsense. He already knows he done fucked up. He just needs to keep his big fat mouth shut and start searching for another job.
,,RetroNight,,,,,Can't really afford one now
,,spectredirector,,,,,"In my state perspective employers aren't allowed to inquire about cause of termination at a previous employer. Nor is the employer allowed to provide that information. It's private protected information. 
 
That means 100% of perspective employees are equal in regards to reason for leaving the last job -- meaning the only way an interviewer can know, by law, is to ask -- and for you to offer that info freely. 
 
If you're not listing the previous employer as a reference -- which you shouldn't -- then the HR people will read what they read. That's no different than most job seekers. 
 
Getting a job is an act that all parties know is being played. Nothing you say will be any different than a dozen other people -- some will lie, the lies are the same, dog ate my homework is not a unique excuse. 
 
Be honest, not transparent. There's zero reason to knock yourself in an interview. You carry yourself with confidence like there's nothing in your past that embarrasses you. 
 
Then -- and this is CRITICAL -- when the interviewer asks you - ""and what do you see as your weak points"" -
 
Or whatever equivalent ""why would you fail at this job?"" Type questions -- that's when you flex a brag.
 
For example:
 
***Well I do really put a lot of pressure on myself -- namely to meet deadlines and really produce work product I know I can be proud of. Sincerely I believe I'm not strong at accepting mediocrity out of myself. If I know a thing could be better than it is, regardless of how incredibly satisfied the client, or management might be -- I'm always my toughest critic.***
 
That's easy. It's true, it's universally accepted as a check in the positive column. Now this may feel disingenuous -- it absolutely is -- but that's irrelevant. Getting a job is a performance, all cast members have expectations of what their prompts are. If you don't deliver your lines correctly, the next actor to speak is confused, and the illusion of the scripted reality breaks. Gotta play the role the directors demand -- offering up negative info is bad acting."
,,CapUmFatEars,,,,,"Someone would have to be really, really stupid to use a reference from a coworker from a company they were fired from especially for moronic behavior. Of course they‚Äôre going to rat the person out, they can‚Äôt resist it. The entertainment factor alone is too great.

However, if they just call the HR department of the old company they‚Äôre going to get just the standard date s worked and salary, maybe reason for leaving but not usually."
,,Richard-Roma-92,,,,,"they're distraught at their behavior being a reason they were fired. they are not distraught at their part in what happened to them. as a matter of fact, their exact words were

*""I did briefly speculate maybe someone wanted me gone, and had gotten a bunch of people to submit stuff against me. Just strange it happened almost a year ago, and another situation a few months ago.""*

This is is classic RVO of DARVO behavior. It's my hope that OP will take a DEI course and realize there's truth in the statement I suggested he use.

Let's be clear -outside of right wing fever dreams - no one is getting fired at work for a single comment.

As far as lying to prospective employers - have you ever READ a resume?"
,,Won_who_wonders,,,,,"I definitely would not provide any details nor mention that you were fired.  Most places won't ask you whether you were fired.  I would say something along the lines like the work culture changed over the past year and that it wasn't a good fit for you.  And don't pause, but tell them 2 or 3 things about their work culture that you are looking for."
,,Inkdrunnergirl,,,,,See my comment. Zero states have laws prohibiting a valid reference and there‚Äôs no federal law.
,,supragtr2006,,,,,"This is not true. If you were terminated, they are legally allowed to tell them for what reason. Truthful statements about your performance and history are always allowed. Only thing they can't disclose is FMLA or other not public information HR manager here. This is a super common misconception. Most have a policy to choose not to because they are afraid someone might be petty and screw the job for them and then bring a lawsuit for lying. Most companies use a website that contains all your information, and they can look up your past history. Never lie. Always be honest in an interview. Have had potential employees do it in the past and we find out they were fired for theft or sexual harassment."
,,Unfair-Business-1962,,,,,My jokes would definitely get me in trouble üòÖ
,,RetroNight,,,,,That might work.
,,Sufficient-Pie8697,,,,,"There‚Äôs nuance to law. So, if a former employer says things that they can be sued for? They won‚Äôt say it; they say not eligible for rehire and leave it there."
,,spectredirector,,,,,"You're basing that on HR people being SHRM or whatever -- actual professional HR. I've worked in multiple big big entities -- corporate and association in particular come to mind -- where the head, and only HR person, was internally promoted to the position a decade prior out of their admin jobs. We're talking about big companies, and their HR departments were a guy who knew how to hand out the employee handbook. 
 
Shit, I worked in a federal facility that didn't have HR. It had -- **get a lawyer*** -- and make a formal request to the Department of Commerce HR. Which in itself was only a middleman stop on its way to another federal ethics office.  
I was hired by a contract company, they had offices a mile away -- they had no ""HR"" -- they had administrative and could grant 6 months temporary security clearance. No one checked shit -- until the FBI did after 6 months. 
 
All the advice is sound, you're clearly a pro and I've been at some places with high functioning HR departments -- those places are constantly switching health insurance cuz idle overhead employees do shit to save the company money. 
 
I hear you. No one should ever lie. In general. 
 
A resume is all lies. Even the true parts. List of skills? 
 
I'm incredibly talented at all the software your company uses. Sincerely -- I saw it demonstrated once, while employed, and I know you like to see it for check box purposes -- so I'm listing it as a ""skill."" 
 
Got a database on that?

,,supragtr2006,,,,,"Yes, like I said, if you are telling the truth and it is not protected information, we can divulge it. Protected is typically medical situations. 90% of the time, if the employee is fired for poor performance, we just tell them they no longer work with us because his performance in a hotel may not be relevant in the IT profession or whatever."
,,supragtr2006,,,,,"My only point is that it's not illegal for us to divulge that information. We do it quite often for specific terminations. 90% of employees they get ""Employee worked from this date to this date."" The ones we tell are violent incidents, sexual harassment, and theft. If its intercompany say the are transferring to a new property they get every detail of their work including performance reviews."
,,spectredirector,,,,,"I hear and see you. My wife is in charge of HR at her place -- not her skill set, just the top of the totem -- but I get what you're talking about. 
 
So lemme tell YOU specifically a story. The caps are not yelling, merely the story is only gonna be appreciated by an HR pro. 
 
So I'm working at this company -- private consultancy, about 450 employees when I started. I work in an education media department, we make digital training. Okay, so the boss who hired me moves on, we got my direct report as interim chief until the uptops bring in this dynamo -- so they claim. 
 
We're talking C level head of department hire from the outside. And this woman had all the credentials -- PhD, adjunct professor, all this other easily verifiable information listed on a resume. Apparently she was also a knock your socks off interview cuz the dummies in charge hired her with gusto and pride. She presided over our department for about 3 months -- and then security had to give her a beat down and have her removed physically. She returned the next Monday to threaten people in the lobby till the cops came.
 
Actual committed schizophrenic.
 
Wasn't a PhD or a professor. A cursory Google search returned her arrest -- at the school she claimed to be chair of a department -- for threatening people after being expelled.
 
From an undergrad program.
 
She'd actually claimed the title of a man at a college who had also had her charged previously with something akin to stalking. 
 
And for 3 months she was my boss.
 
She stared at blank sheets of paper for hours.
 
She giggled like a child at the concept of a laptop docking station. 
 
When security delivered the beat down it was in the atrium outside my cubicle -- the head of HR -- a C level person herself, also ex-military -- she squared off with this psycho and won. It was brutal and embarrassing AF for all involved. 
 
That office had an entire floor of HR staff. I know cuz I saw the termination notices as that place collapsed. Overhead employees are the first to go obviously.
 
Anyway. Thought maybe you'd appreciate how badly some really successful businesses do hiring. That place was a huge money maker for 35 years. Only went to shit after the 2014 government shutdown and austerity measures. 
 
What a fucked hire. 
 
~fƒ´n~"
,,supragtr2006,,,,,Dear god. We always do a linkedin or google search and definitely background checks.
,,spectredirector,,,,,"That ex-military head of HR -- she once called my entire team into an office -- told us: ""I'm not your friend, I can't be friends with people I might have to fire"" -- then dismissed us. 
 
Then was never friendly to anyone ever. Especially when physically handling a 50+ year old crazy lady up against a plexiglass ""security"" door. 
 
Super high-end office. Fanciest bullshit big corporate consultancy of 400+ with at least 51 being expendable overhead HR employees. 
 
My manager got her resume on file -- we, her staff slash potential slasher victims, did a Google search in an admins office like half the building over cuz this shit was so beyond illegal probably. Door closed, you got like 3 production line people and a middle manager looking at these news reports from known publications of this woman's madness.

"Accepted a Job Offer, but Dream Company Wants an Interview - What to Do?",15fk0be,atreule_ilom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/15fk0be/accepted_a_job_offer_but_dream_company_wants_an/,13,16,1690913123.0,
,,capoot,,,,,"I'd secure the first job and then interview with the dream job. If their offer seems good enough, then I'd let the company I work for know I got a better offer and see their response then go with the best option. You're not burning bridges as long as you give them plenty of notice."
,,DRBSFNYC,,,,,"Take the interview and don't worry about it until they submit an offer. If so, need to do what's best for you. Though company one likes you now if they went on a layoff spree loyalty is out the window... 

Yes you will burn bridges but it is a big workforce and they will forget about you/move on eventually also. Look at all the tech layoffs now in the 1000s every other week. Don't bring too much emotion to the process as that does not go both ways when times are tough on their side either... They're not your family and just make it fact based and look for red flags."
,,amazinghl,,,,,Aces the interview and get the offer on the table first.
,,GoPadge,,,,,"Do your due diligence when interviewing the dream company... Don't let your excitement for a potential employer, blind you to warning signs that things aren't as good as you hope they will be."

,,Future_Dog_3156,,,,,"I would continue to move forward with both your job AND the interview. I would absolutely interview. Employers are not loyal to employees so you should absolutely explore this opportunity. While interviewing, you may learn more about the company, its culture and its employees, and you may decide you are a good fit or not. 

I am someone that was offered my dream job with an amazing company. They said they would hire me at the interview (I was there half a day and interviewed with 5 people AND had lunch with executives). Compensation would have been more than my current job but I turned it down. No regrets, though. I explored it and did not want to do it. It was in the office 4 days a week. I have been WFH full time for 10+ yrs. I managed to make an excellent salary WFH and raising my kids. Never missed a school play or soccer game. It wasn't the life I wanted. In talking it over with my dad, he said they are willing to pay more bc you will need to work more. lol  Good luck to you OP."

,,Henry-Moody,,,,,"In 2019 I couldn't find work in Eugene, Or. Plenty of jobs.. paying a rate a high school kid would find attractive. No ty.

Moved to San Diego for job paying better, figured it was a stepping stone. Had good relationship with boss and it was a temp to hire.

Offered more money by a recruiting mouthpiece at a different position. Left first position.

Immediate regrets at 2nd position and realized I made a mistake leaving at the 5 hour mark of the day. At the 4 hour mark at lunch I returned badge to company 1, so I no longer had access to that work. Apparently once you hand the badge in, that's it as far as HR is concerned. The position is closed. The manager had warned me to hold onto my badge.......

&#x200B;

The company I was working for had draconian policies, had legally changed their names multiple times to evade bad reviews. It was just awful. Week and a half in, I got a call from my dream company saying they wanted to interview. Took them 4 months to get to me. I could not request time off work, I had no vacation etc so I called in sick. They dismissed me a couple days later, unhappy I missed a day..

It will still be there, maybe more patched up, maybe less, and there will be easier days and harder days, but the paper remains

,,chloeclover,,,,,Yep. I have had a successful career and most of my job experiences were really toxic. Thankfully as you get older you learn to spot it and stand up for yourself and leave sooner.

,,Great_Gate_1653,,,,,"As a young man first real job out of HS I went to work at a place where the shop Supervisor was a raging alcoholic and an unhappy a hole.  My job was to do all of the deliveries from the shop to the job sites.  He would call me during deliveries and start yelling the minute I'd answer.  Yelling at me for mistakes Jouneyman  in the shop would make fabricating yet my fault just for delivering.  One time I was carefully loading sheet metal parts into the truck and he yanked it out of my hands as I wasn't fast enough.  Cost me 1/2 days pay and 7 stitches in my arm as it sliced me deep.  Many more stories but in short after I quit it was a full year to stop jumping every time my phone would ring.

,,cost_guesstimator54,,,,,"Last 8 months at my previous employer left me with a massive chip on my shoulder. Watched them fire my mentor and bring in a new hire. They proceed to tell us we report to her a d she reports to our director. Walked into my yearly review ready to discuss what I needed to do to get promoted. After going through the standard review (high marks for the 3rd year in a row) the director then states ge knows I'm going to ask how to get to the next level but he has no idea how to get me there. I'm sitting there speechless then he adds injury to insult. My raise was 1.5 percentage points less than the previous year and my bonus was $5,500 less than the last one. Only reason he gave was I didn't handle enough projects that year (ironic since he makes the assignments). What little good will my director had left from me evaporated. I realized they'd rather hire outsiders than promote and the bonus system was designed in a manner only senior people had a chance to hit the max goal. Now I'm pretty critical of leadership and don't believe a word anyone says."

I left that company 5 months ago.

,,Glitter_moonchild,,,,,"Ok this might be really random and maybe some of you will laugh because In a way it sounds so dumb. so I had this job I really liked I was there for a few years and a doctor I worked with would try pushing your buttons, was nosey and point out any chances you made about yourself like new earrings, new hair color, different makeup etc. I don‚Äôt remember what happened exactly one day but apparently I started to blush and he pointed it out and everyone was looking and omg it was just terrible and everytime he would talk to me he would try making me blush (I‚Äôm light skinned and turn red right away) and ever since then I have this triggered ptsd where I can‚Äôt even look at people in the eye to talk anymore because I get nervous and start to blush. I can still talk normal to my closest friends but to strangers and for work I can‚Äôt and I hate that and it makes me so sad because I have a hard time going to job interviews and doing anything in general that requires me talking.

,,Additional-Local8721,,,,,"Absolutely. I worked claims for a large insurance company in the call center. We could not control the flow of calls, as soon as one call hung up, the next was already on the line. In the 4 years I worked there, I took several death claims, one girl feel off a boat and got cut up by the motor, one guy got decapitated by heavy machinery, motor cycle accident with no pads ...etc. It's hard listening to a crying person while asking questions to fill out a form. And then the call ends and the next person comes on and I'm supposed to just move on like nothing happened and smile. I still remember taking claims calls during Hurricane Sandy and telling people to get off the phone and seek safety. Why the hell they call their insurance company thinking we would do anything immediately is beyond me."
,,,,,,,"Higher ed is a sh*tshow and bad managers and emotional abuse are so common! The worst manager I had was extremely manipulative, would gaslight me and lie to others about what my skillset was. She isolated me from everyone else in the office. Did the same thing to my teammate - we never had team meetings so that she could maintain her complex web of lies with each of us separately. Every email that i sent had to be read and edited by her first. She would edit and edit and edit my reports back and forth, delaying them for months, and each version was poorer quality. She was eventually fired. That was a couple of years ago, I am still recovering. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my voice and my confidence. I quit that job because I just could not get my confidence back or figure out how to integrate myself with everyone else, having been so isolated. 

I hope you recover soon! That‚Äôs great that you are seeing a therapist. I just starting seeing one and am starting to unpack all of this. I can‚Äôt say I have figured out how to move on, but I know there must be a way out of this."
,,,,,,,Curious - did you end up leaving higher ed? I have had a string of bad experiences working in higher ed - it really does attract people who value social status and have no problem with exploiting others if it means getting what they want. I want out!
,,bad-bangs,,,,,"Yes, I left higher ed for a communications job at a small nonprofit (15-20 people on staff). I did my research on the organization before I accepted the job because I knew I couldn‚Äôt handle another toxic work environment. In general, I think smaller organizations that are mission-driven (and appropriately resourced) attract staff who are less concerned with status. Good luck with your search!"

,,hetty_sorrel,,,,,"I hate it too. I'm mid-career and at my 5th company, and unfortunately being the new person still sucks. My dad used to say the same thing.

My current job is fully remote so some issues are gone, like feeling that I have to walk around the office every day with a sh\*tty smile lol, but I think trust takes longer to build.

For context, I started a year ago but I have 22 years in the industry. Last week a few of us had computer issues and a co-worker posted on Teams that he'd called IT and was waiting for a call back. I replied that I'd opened an online ticket, so we had all the bases covered. One of our managers commented and tagged me to say that it was OK to use the IT site BUT if a computer issue was preventing me from doing work, I should call IT and not wait.

Lol. Wow, really?! I thought if I had a problem I should just stare at the ceiling and wait for someone to notice I'm getting no work done üòÇ (I'm sure the manager meant well...but it's a little frustrating)"
,,DanDangerx,,,,,I understand how you feel.  I'm 4 months into my current position and the nearest person to me is like 5 years minimum.  It's the effect of time I guess. I'm struggling to get on with it cause they look at me like I've been there as long as they have. Tbh their attitude is feeling toxic and impacts my mental health a wee bit. I'm only young and starting my career I don't think this will be my forever position/company but I'd least try to be positive about my day.
,,SkullAngel001,,,,,">That being said, I just finished my second week at the job,

Think about that for a second. You blinked and two weeks are done. That's two weeks less of you being the new guy and you knowing about the job & culture more than you did on Day 1. Imagine when you look back (like you're doing now) and you realize it's your fourth, ninth or thirteenth month on the job. 

In other words, you're thinking about it all wrong. Being the new guy will come and go before you know it. The way that happens is you focus on learning & becoming good at the job, asking a crap ton of questions, and taking copious amounts of notes. 

>I like to ask for help, but I don't want to bother them.

On the contrary, employers get nervous & become suspicious if you DON'T ask questions. It's also the employer's responsibility to ensure they're available to accommodate you as you learn your way, even to the point where people get annoyed that you're asking so many questions."
,,SoundCloud9,,,,,Can totally relate. I feel like I dont get the same respect being the new person and being younger than everyone else too. I try to work hard to show that I am capable of being a good employee and want to work but I feel like it just goes over their head.

You will work very hard for 5-6 years and your mental health will suffer. Now that I‚Äôm on the other side, I‚Äôd say it was totally worth it."
,,ThrowawayJallopy,,,,,"I'm a corporate recruiter, so I see a lot of roles / market salaries (note that my company is located in a relatively large city with relatively high cost of living, though not the Bay area or NYC, so these numbers may not apply in low cost of living areas. And you gotta take them with a grain of salt since if your rent is 2200/mo for a 2 bedroom apartment, your salary won't go as far - but you can always get roommates or with so many jobs going remote now you can live further outside the city, lower your cost of living but still collect the city paycheck.


Definitely more technical roles can easily get 6 figures with somewhat limited experience (this is based off our internal market comparison data for roles I've recently recruited for):

I see Product Owners at software companies (not all Big Tech names, just technology companies in general tends to have a higher premium on talent, as can pharma or biotech companies) with ~5+ years experience making 100- 120k in cities like Austin or Denver (and some have liberal arts background, they've taken courses/certifications and might start in smaller companies). 

You can make good money in sales if you're comfortable with commission-based pay and with schmoozing on the phone, especially, again, in the technology or healthcare tech spaces - base pay isn't that high initially but it is what you make of it since commission caps are often high. 

Software, obviously. Starting salaries for developers out of school (again, not in rural areas, rural areas probably more like 50k) start ~65k-80k, and can quickly progress into 6 figures. Engineering in general pays well. 


I've seen folks in accounting / audit coming out of ~3-5 years in a Big 4 firm (these are huge and do a lot of hiring. You can also start at a smaller company and then transition into Big 4 if you're having trouble getting in from the get-go) typically around the 100k mark. 


I'm not really sure about starting salaries in IT, marketing, or general finance. In HR they typically start a bit lower. If you're considering recruiting and are looking to hasten your salary, I'd look at executive search firms - there's a higher premium in those executive-oriented roles than you'll find in agency or in-house. 


So in general, I'd recommend looking at companies in the technology or pharma/biotech spaces where salaries tend to be higher than other industries. I'd look at moving closer to a major city, or applying to remote roles where the company is based in a major city. If the recruiter asks you about your comp expectations, say that you ""haven't given it enough thought yet, do they have a range they could share with you that they're targeting?"" - get them to share their range so you can get a sense of what they think the job is worth and go from there. Also do research on Glassdoor so you have an idea of what is typical comp for the roles you're exploring. 

And don't be afraid to negotiate - when I was starting out all these numbers seemed huge and like, why would I deserve to be paid more than this? But in big corporations, it's just a number to them. They've got a range to work in, and the recruiter who's working with you has 2 motivations once they've decided to make you an offer: 1) get you at a number that is in the set out range and 2) get you a number where they think you'll want to say yes. Sometimes if they can't go up on the base they'll throw you a 5k signing bonus or something instead, or if they can't go up on base you can try negotiating for increased PTO instead. 

Be confident and don't worry about asking for too much- if you do go higher than they can do, they'll tell you. Definitely learned a bit from rubbing shoulders with peer colleagues who grew up wealthy - these numbers are smaller to them so they ask for more with confidence that that's normal and reasonable, and often they get it. You don't get what you don't ask for. 

I am now making 6 figures (6-7 years experience in executive recruiting, only recently switched into a corporate recruiting role in my company so kept my salary even though it's higher than normal for a corporate recruiter). Some of that was circumstantial luck where my prior small company had a lot of attrition and threw some raises at me to stay which bumped my salary up a lot, and then I got promotions as well that bumped me, but when I switched to a large corporation (with 4-5 years experience) and asked for 6 figures, neither one of the two that made me an offer batted an eye."
,,YelloRhinoDino,,,,,"Worked my way up the corporate ladder and felt like a slave, making the owners rich while I was miserable. Didn't make 6 figures but those bonuses added up. 

Decided I'd had enough and wanted to start my own business. After dabbling in a couple of things, I found Local Lead Generation and put in the time and effort to build a foundation that would cover basic living expenses and allow me to quit my job.

Once I reached the point of being able to focus full time on lead gen, my income went from $8k a month to $40k in 8 months. I've been smashing 6-figures a year since then and have control over my time.

My only regret - not finding this sooner and missing out on family experiences because of those long hours, travel, and all the corporate BS before."

,,Auggiewestbound,,,,,"That was a bad time to enter the workforce. I was technically supposed to graduate in 2008 but hung around in school for another year to get my degree. 

Shit was hard at first.

First job paid me $15 an hour at a nonprofit. Closed after 5 months. 

Next job was a marketing assistant job that paid me $13 an hour to send mailers. Hated it. Stuck it out for a year. 

That gave me just enough experience to get my next job that paid me slightly more - $19 an hour. 

After a year and a half that helped me get my first salaried job. 

And that first salaried job got me my current job, where I've been for 6 years. 

You have to remember to take the long view. I know it's hard, but it's crucial. I applied to hundreds of jobs early on. I interviewed all over. I got rejected a lot. But you just have remember that it won't always be this way for you. 

Also don't worry if your first job isn't glamorous. Appreciate it for what it is and, get some experience, and find the next best thing when the time is right."

I joined the military and I'm 11 years in. I earned my undergraduate degree, have no student loan debt, I've been to 8 countries, met some really cool people, own my own house, have a great chunk of change in my retirement account, and there is still tons of room for me to move up. I love what I do and generally, it's an awesome deal. Free healthcare for myself and my dependents, 30 days of paid leave every year and 42 days of free leave when you have a child if you're the primary caregiver. 

There are drawbacks.. 

I was deployed and I did get shot at (just mortars... not that big of a deal). BUT being deployed was one of the coolest things I've ever done! The memories I shared with the people I met and perspective I gained while downrange are some of the best I'll ever have. I originally worked in a career field that had very long hours outdoors with a very low tolerance for human error which was very stressful. You do have to deal with poor leadership every now and again but the good thing about the military is that everyone moves around all the time so you won't have to deal with it for very long. 

It's not for everyone but for me, it's great. While there were many kids my age who were very smart and got wonderful grades... many of them don't have the same job security or even have the same quality of life that I do."
,,jack_bag,,,,,"By doing the best you can given the circumstances. I counted my blessings - I was both lucky in some ways and very unlucky in others. I fought hard and won some battles, and should have fought harder in others I was too fatigued to realize the gravity of. 

Advice for today - Learn to draw a very distinct line between what you are responsible for and what you are not responsible for. That means you don‚Äôt wallow in the crap circumstances, and you also don‚Äôt just hide out and wait for it to pass. 

The world is drastically different from a year ago. The opportunities that had been there all along changed. Other opportunities opened up. Continue to invest in yourself - education, whatever gainful employment and networking you can find, whatever volunteering you can uncover to give to others in a time where there is great need."
,,justpetyrr,,,,,"Make sure you keep working in your field somehow even if your day job isn‚Äôt. If you need a job but can‚Äôt find one in your field: find a company that likes to hire college grads, but is indifferent to the degree (they typically have ‚Äúmanagement trainee‚Äù programs- I landed at enterprise).  Just make sure you keep looking in your field and for something like web dev I‚Äôd say make sure you keep working on projects so you can show what you‚Äôve got."
,,EighthDayOfficial,,,,,"I'd say the best advice is to plan for a Masters. I picked a field I would be ok with getting a PhD in and the plan was to stay in school until I found a job.

I got a PhD now, but given the job I have, I would have been better off finding this job after the masters (PhD is not required and also came with additional debt)."
,,PYTN,,,,,"So I graduated in 2013, but we were still feeling the ""5 years of experience for an entry level job"" effects.

As someone who previously helped build a web dev company from 3 to 17 people, let me offer some advice. Find the meetups related to tech. Network. Reach out. My developers who had the best career arcs also knew sales and had management skills. (I'm aware that you can't network in person now, but as soon as it's safe, do it as often as possible).

In terms of applying, the 2 hour job search book is a lifesaver for your sanity. It'll tell you how to reach out and get in front of people.

,,heretolearn2,,,,,"For me, money plays a huge role in that ‚Äúunhappiness tax‚Äù. I have a great job that some might consider a ‚Äúdream‚Äù to have. In fact, so many people desire to have this kind of job that it makes it easy for HR and those above to keep the salary low despite the hard work and long hours required. It is also hard to see movement because people don‚Äôt leave or retire making the road toward promotion even more crowded and interminable. 

I am miserable because of the pay. It also saddens me to think about the possibility of switching careers for an increase in pay, finally being able to fully support myself but no longer being fulfilled by my work. Currently, my whole life revolves around work but I have nothing to show for it financially. It is often hard to swallow that the grass isn‚Äôt greener.

The job I took barely pays enough for me to cover my expenses, and so when the pandemic ends in my region I'll be getting another job to help out, which will take time away from my hobbies and other things I enjoy. 

That being said, part of that is my fault, I didn't ask the right questions about what deductions would be taken from my paycheck (taxes, pension plan, etc.). I'm glad I took the job, but I don't know if I would do it again knowing what I know now!

You might try this exercise to help your preferences become more apparent. Take a look at all of the aspects of your life, what things do you like and what don't you like? You can do a list for work too, but the answer often comes out of non-work preferences. It might take some coaxing to get your brain to come up with something, but once you get going it's easier.

,,dongdesk,,,,,"Crossroads like this in your career are interesting.  On one hand, things are cozy and simple.  Almost chill, you know what to do each day...low stress.  You have a manager or higher to deal with all those things you don't want to deal with.

However...as time goes on and 10 years goes into 20 years...you will have a different problem, who wants me when I have been doing the same thing for 20 years at the company goes through layoffs and I hit the market?

On the other hand, management path is an option.  Higher pay, likely less hands on and more operational.  You will suddenly have to care about things like budgets, making sure things are running, employee performance, motivating people, etc.

That is life, more money means more responsibility and risk.  Capitalism rewards risk takers."
,,Top-Introduction-397,,,,,"I'll go for the dead-end job.  
  
I think that when you're so stressed out that you don't want to do your job anymore, it's not worth it. You're never going to be able to advance in your career if you're miserable every day. If it's a dead-end job and you're just going to stay there forever, then it's not worth the stress. You need to be able to look forward to something and see how your efforts will pay off with increased responsibility or more money in order for it all to make sense."

,,PhiIIay,,,,,"I think if you can handle the stress right now, take the chance for career growth opportunities because it could lead to something less stressful in the end with a higher income.

As long as you don't leave on bad terms, you could always try the career advancement and higher pay and if it doesn't work out or you just really don't like it then you could always go back (again, assuming you don't leave on bad terms)"
,,Electronic-Park-5091,,,,,"Depends on if you can see yourself as a manager. Individual contributors get to focus on themselves and have minimal stress. Managers have a lot to deal with. Personally, I‚Äôd go for the stress free job and look for a new job I‚Äôm interested in."
,,Imaginary_Artichoke,,,,,"I recently had the same crossroad in 2021 and looking back I still have no idea if I chose correctly.  You need to think about what makes you content, and how you want your work life balance to be and see what makes sense for you.   

I went upward mobility route and found myself less stressed, but more frustrated about different things I didn't expect.  Managing projects in a company with poor structure and little direction.  Trying to encourage and empower people who don't want to make decisions to make them, etc.  Personally, I prefer being challenged.

Moral of the story: They all suck equally just choose one!"
,,Express_Giraffe_7902,,,,,"There are many kinds of stressful - is it stressful going to keep you awake at night and affect your health? Probably shouldn‚Äôt take the job ‚Ä¶ but if it‚Äôs stressful because you‚Äôre going to have to learn some new skills/stressful because it‚Äôs unknown, well then maybe you do want to take it!

The upward mobility - is it upwards into a place you want to go/helps you accomplish your goals? Or is the upward mobility into a place you‚Äôve never wanted to go? Example ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a data analyst and there‚Äôs upward mobility into data science or management (others, too, but keeping it simple) - I don‚Äôt want to go into data science, so a new job as a data scientist isn‚Äôt for me even if there‚Äôs significant upward mobility in that space"

,,itsfrankgrimesyo,,,,,Thank you for this perspective. Truly gives me something to consider.
,,dongdesk,,,,,I think it depends on the place and the role you have.  I know some people at the later end of their career that take a step back and get into a chill non competitive role and just really emerse themselves into a speciality.
,,dongdesk,,,,,"Yes I was.  Roughly 5 or so years ago. I was already positioning myself for a change into leadership.  I was getting older and in the same role for about 10 years and figured out that I would be competing with younger talent (software). Dabbled in some projects and other stretch tasks.  

I took the leadership role and it let to two promotions in 4 years and doubled my income. 

Worth it? Some days yes, other days I say ""be careful what you ask for"".  I don't enjoy having to keep up with young people as you get older and the brain is not as quick. In management and higher, it is more about being consistent and steady.  Caring for others and the company more than yourself.

I also changed companies and that de-burdened me."
,,Apparenttopography,,,,,"Believe me I am at the same position right now. Couldn't help but identify myself with you. Equally perplexed ü§û

Hopefully it will be for the best"
,,PhiIIay,,,,,"Even if you can't go back to the same place, given your 10 years of experience, I'm fairly certain you could still find a very similar job to what you already have now. 

So yes, even if I can't go back my answer would remain the same. What would kill me more is regretting not having taken an opportunity for growth when I had the chance, because that can turn into something bigger and better.

I think people by nature are just scared of change and they grow comfortable with their day to day. There's also nothing wrong with that, because some people are perfectly fine with their routine, but I'm just the type of person to strive for constant growth, and if I have the opportunity to learn something new and getting paid more to do it, then I would jump right on it. 

It will most likely be more stressful in the beginning because you're learning a new skill, but once you master it, it will become easier over time as well."

I decided to look into different career fields and found myself drawn to Human Resources. I am currently in a MBA program for HR Management and have a couple interviews lined up in that department. So what I suggest is do some soul searching, find what you‚Äôre passionate about. I never would have thought I‚Äôd go back to school but here I am.

,,shannonlpostak,,,,,"Hi, I'm Shannon. I'm a career and executive coach with 20 years of work experience, maybe I can help.

Yes, it's called a pivot interview. It's not uncommon when you're moving from one industry to another. 

My weirdest pivot interview was when I wanted to get out of NYC and into professional dog mushing in Alaska. I'd only been on a dog sled once, but I'd read every book on the subject and followed all the races, and I was super/obsessed passionate about it. AND I was willing to do the lowliest of jobs to get my foot in the door. 

How you sell yourself is honestly. Do not lie. It will burn you. 

For me, I was open about what I did and didn't know, but I also told them how my current skills translated to mushing and how I could help their business with all the skills and experience I had from other industries and jobs. 

And it worked. I started as an entry level position and worked up to the position I wanted. 

Are you looking to pivot?"
,,luridfox,,,,,"Yes I briefly had a career in sales, and for the time it made me a lot of money and had perks. I hated it and am no longer there, I wasn't even great.

Before the interview I read a lot on the company, and memorized a few numbers on what they sell, how many of the different types, and how they are categorized. It was a group interview, me and 3 others going for one position. I was later told that I could state those facts and numbers led them to believing I was well researched. It is the reason I was chosen. I'd looked them up in the parking garage 5 minutes before.

That and answering all your questions based around their mission statement/company goals."

,,MrMikeGriffith,,,,,"I've just finished (except the final exam) a course in organizational behavior as part of my MBA curriculum. Advice I can share from this course:

* Books recommended by the professor were ""Managing With Power: Politics and Influence in Organizations"" by Pfeffer and ""Influence"" by Cialdini.
* If you can put yourself in a position to connect 2 or more groups in the workplace that are not normally connected, you will be very valuable
* If you have any issues with self-monitoring, you should learn to address these. If you usually speak your mind without thinking about it, this can be detrimental.
* Conversely, people tend to avoid working with others they feel are not genuine. Self-deception and impression management are often both negatively correlated with the extent to which others choose to network with you or team with you.
* Be mindful of internal capital markets. (This is not from OB per se). You don't want to be so much of a shark that people avoid you, but don't forget to view the internal divisions, resources, etc. in your company through this lens.

Best of luck in your career!!"

,,Crashtag,,,,,Gonna go out on a limb here and say there ain‚Äôt no counter coming. You gave a notice - that‚Äôs the right thing to do. Send a nice note out or do a LI post if it makes you feel better. People change jobs - it‚Äôs very normal. And companies will drop people for no good reason and not think twice about it. You‚Äôre good to go.
,,74006-M-52-----,,,,,I would not stress this at all.  Move to the new company.  You gave them a chance.
,,vms09,,,,,"They‚Äôve shown you exactly how much of a priority you are. If the company were as concerned about retaining your talent, you‚Äôd have a written offer within a few days.

The environment and morale post lay off‚Äôs are pretty shitty for the remaining people, and there is no guarantee they won‚Äôt do additional layoffs. Your boss doesn't seem mature enough to handle an environment like that, or to be an adult and not take your initial resignation personally. 

Additionally, you'll be onboarding and getting your feet under you for a while, so the first few weeks at the new job will be a pretty good slow period to decompress and recharge. 

Accept the new job. Sail off into the sunset towards your new adventure."
,,Sinisterminister77,,,,,My company did the exact same thing to me. A good company though. Take the other offer

,,Tricky-Helicopter-56,,,,,Easy. Fuck your current company go with the new one. You were interviewing for a reason it's either because you weren't paid enough or the work wasn't challenging but that really at the end of the day that company wasn't a good fit for you. They will absolutely look at you as being unloyal now and if they're already doing layoffs like that I wouldn't trust it either

,,isshearobot,,,,,"Counter will not matter if you too get laid off in a few months. Take the new job. If an employer doesn‚Äôt value you enough to offer a raise before you tender your resignation, they won‚Äôt value you after the raise. Many people who accept the counter and stay are no expected to do more work and perform better for that money. I also imagine I‚Äôd the counter does exist the people that agreed to it did so incredibly begrudgingly given the companies current state and there would be a lot of resentment directed at you should you take it and choose to stay."
,,Goopyteacher,,,,,"I‚Äôd just like to ask, what do you think is going to happen if they give you a counter offer that matches the new place? Assuming it goes through tomorrow, what‚Äôs the game plan here? 

Are you going to be staying at a job that‚Äôs going to be laying people off soon? Ignoring the fact more expensive employees are often the first to be let go (you) even if they kept you on after the layoffs, you‚Äôll likely be taking on the additional workload of the people missing. So you‚Äôll be making the same you would from a different job, with the stress of being laid off looming over your head, to maybe survive the layoffs and then face even more burnout as you work 2 people‚Äôs jobs to compensate. 

Why are you waiting?"
,,Unexpected_bukkake,,,,,"Yo! Leave that company now. There's no counter offer and you'd get laid off soon anyway.

,,kevofasho,,,,,When I change jobs I just put in notice. If they panic and get me an offer before the 2 weeks is up then you‚Äôll have something to consider but if not the new job always takes priority.
,,agent_smith_3012,,,,,"Forget the counter offer. If they were serious, it would be in writing and in your hand already. Even if they do manage to offer you something enticing, the well will be poisoned. You would probably face animosity and constructive dismissal if you stay."
,,weight22,,,,,"I don't know why you are worried - they have NOT prioritized getting this counteroffer to you.

If anything, this should make your decision easier.   Run to the new job & don't look back!"
,,JJHall_ID,,,,,"You accepted the offer and gave notice to your old employer.  Your notice doesn't start on the day they hand you a counter offer, if they ever do, it started the day you gave them notice.

You already made your decision when you accepted the new offer.  If your old company wanted you to reconsider that decision, they needed to put something on the table.  They haven't, so I don't know why you feel like you need to make another decision.

Personally, having worked at a company that laid people off regularly, I recommend you take the new job and don't look back.  Do your best to have all of your current work handed off to other people by the time your notice runs out.  That's what you do to not burn bridges.  If the person on the other end of the bridge decides to light the bridge for you, that's on them, and not your fault.

Everything you're saying tells me your gut says to move on, with the exception of not getting a counter offer.  Not getting one is loud and clear communication from them.  Go with your gut, take the better job, and be happy!"
,,FlapJackson420,,,,,"Yeah, definitely move on to the new job. It sounds like maybe your manager *personally* values you, maybe even to the extent they don't want to admit to their superiors - maybe they can't imagine performing their job well without you, maybe something else. It also sounds like they didn't have the go-ahead from up top to match the offer and haven't figured out how to play their next move - don't wait around to find out what that is, the ship is burning."
,,xbluedog,,,,,"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS give a drop dead date for the receipt of the counter. 

If they don‚Äôt meet it they aren‚Äôt serious and it could easily jeopardize your new gig. Frankly by delaying, the current company is hoping they‚Äôll be able to disrupt your new offer such that it gets pulled and they can keep you without actually having to make good on the counter. 

They‚Äôre shady AF. Move to the new company."

,,Recruiting10,,,,,RUN RUN RUN
,,Select_Ad2050,,,,,"To me, any counter-offer is a flat out admission the maker has intentionally paid you less than you were worth to them.  In short, it is a slap in the face."
,,MindfulAthlete,,,,,"There are very, very few times when I think taking a counter offer is the best option and this is certainly not one of them. The reasons you were on the market in the first place won‚Äôt change bc of the counter offer and the counter offer itself is clearly not a priority for the organization. Move on and start fresh. Communicate to your current employer that you appreciate the time spent with them but it‚Äôs time for you to move on and keep it simple"
,,anita1louise,,,,,"Usually companies think that once you turn in your notice your work is going to suffer. So they will send you on your way. If they can‚Äôt afford to let you go right away, they will talk this ‚Äúcounter offer‚Äù crap to make you keep doing your job. Just do like always and take new job."
,,Automatic_Tear9354,,,,,They have to get approval from multiple divisions before they present the offer. It takes forever and it‚Äôs usually just a salary match. Time to move on especially if they‚Äôre doing a round of layoffs. Only way I‚Äôd stay is if they matched the pay and signed a 2 year employment contract.

,,PatientWorry,,,,,Both
,,GoldenGoddess_333,,,,,"Depends on your commute! 4 day work week would be great, but maybe not if you‚Äôre in the office and commuting 4 hours a day (2hrs each way‚Ä¶ very possible here in LA), that would leave you with 16 hours commute time taxed onto your week in this scenario."
,,fancy_marmot,,,,,"Permanent WFH.

Saving 2 hours a day not commuting. Way more energy - I'm no longer exhausted at the end of the work day. I'm not one of those people who use coworkers for their social interaction needs. Zero need to go sit in an office. Way, WAY more productive with WFH, since I don't have constant interruptions. Not constantly getting sick from people coming in with colds, flu, stomach viruses. I can focus better on bigger projects and have finished several that I had been trying to get done for years. I've been able to work from my parents' house for half the week, so I can spend time with them on my lunch break and help with things after work. Post-pandemic, I can work from a share-space, park or coffee shop next door if I want a change of scenery.

WFH has been fantastic for the team dynamic of my work as well. We have staff Zoom meetings/checkins every week and use that time to catch up and chitchat. Use Teams to chat if hace an immediate question. No more gossip/negativity, everyone is much happier, and productivity is up. The ones who used work for their social needs have been making friends or connecting with family instead. I'd honestly rather work an extra day each week if it came between that and WFH."

I worked at an agency for clients where I was constantly on call and everything was a fire drill; I thought I just hated being on the client service side, so I left and went to a company where I was the client thinking that was what I wanted all along.

Personally I feel that a marketing career isnt great for just about anyone that wants a better work life balance, but that‚Äôs based on my past experience and the people I worked with. If you‚Äôre really set on marketing or a similar role I would recommend looking into roles that don‚Äôt focus on web elements of marketing - emails, website or social media.

Have a compelling vision of how you want to live your life and strive to progress towards that goal every day. Don't be a football of other people's opinion.

What do you mean? That's literally 9 or 10 hour work shifts EVERY FUCKING DAY. In what world is that ""not a ton""?

I'm just going to put it to you straight. You need to move. I live in a very nice area and you can get a retail job here for $15-$17/hour easily and an apartment that would be significantly better than your ""roach infested 1 bedroom apartment"" for $900-$1000 a month. That would immediately boost your income and reduce your expenses by a lot and allow you to spend more of your time finding a better opportunity. (The other obvious choice here is to get a roommate if you aren't able to move)

,,ABA20011,,,,,"I can‚Äôt tell you what steps to take, but i can give you a little but of hope.  I graduated from college and didn‚Äôt get any traction applying for jobs through the career center.  Like zero interviews.

I managed to find a job in retail that i didn‚Äôt really like, and i had to work weekends.  i did that job for a couple of years and I was OK at it even though i didn‚Äôt like it.  I learned about technology through the process.  After a couple years i was able to move to another position with that company.  No more weekends.  Again, didn‚Äôt really like it, but did OK.  Then a promotion.  Then a MBA.  All of a sudden i had tech experience, sales experience, and a business degree.  That set me up to move into a new industry.  Got a job where i was bored out of my skull, but stuck with it, got more reps.  But that set me up to move into a job that paid well and I really enjoyed.  That last position was 25 years ago and i have made a career of it, and do very well financially.  Lots of hard work, lots of time away from my family, but I live a good life.

You never know where those menial jobs will lead if you are willing to work hard and bring a good attitude.  When i was coming out of college i had NO idea where i was headed.  I just figured it out step by step, and sucked it up for as along as i could doing things i didn‚Äôt like until I could take the next step.

You don‚Äôt need to have your whole life figured out.  Just set one goal and work towards it.  Then the next.  And, for gosh sakes, don‚Äôt get caught up comparing yourself to anyone else, especially all of these ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù.  Find something small that makes you and work towards it."

,,SweetCosmicPope,,,,,"Here's the thing:  you are a 20 year old senior at a decent college.  You are actually ahead of the curve.  It seems tough now.  You're getting towards the end of this chapter and you're starting to feel the burn, but you have to stick it out and finish the degree.  More than anything that is of the utmost importance.  In the long run, worrying about what dead end job you're going to be working to make ends meet is fairly trivial, especially if you can get by for now.  If you can deal with the shitty living situation and stress of balancing school and work for just a little while longer, you'll be in a great position to start your career.

What is it that made you want to go for this particular degree?  Do you have a business you're interested in starting?   Maybe brainstorm with some of your peers in school for what comes next.  Maybe you can start figuring out a business to go in on together to lessen the financial risk to each of you.  As part of your studies, you're likely learning about raising capital.  This is a great skill to have if you're going to be working with venture capitalists at all.  Tech startups are going to be looking for people with degrees such as yourself to assist in putting together prospectives for their clients to raise money.

What I'd suggest is start looking for internships in the coming semester.  Many big organizations have programs that bring in interns in their junior and senior years, and if they cut the mustard during their internship they are offered a well-paying full-time job when they graduate."

It would get you good benefits and a pension even if it's not your dream job.  They have programs for recent graduates and there are federal jobs all over the nation so you could probably find something fairly close to your family.

They don't know how many applications you submit so don't worry about that, and it just takes one responding to land a job."

,,Spiritual_Ad1084,,,,,"This is my advice to all young people who are lost similar to what you seem to be: Start with figuring out your why. Like why are you doing what you‚Äôre doing? And What is my calling in life? That will create clarity in life and give you direction. Then talk with your school‚Äôs career center about how you can get connected with people who are currently where you want to be. Then with their guidance, start networking and use the phrase, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to grow and learn.‚Äù Most recruiters love this and this will likely open up doors to jobs that you don‚Äôt feel qualified for. You just need one person to give you a chance and then work your tail off for them. 

Right out of college, I got a job with a hospitality company and I had a leader invest time and money into me. It sucked at first, but I worked hard and learned a lot (made so many mistakes) and am in a really great spot 8 years later. 

Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that working 65 to 70 hours a week is not a lot. It is a ton. 

Also check to see if your career center does interview coaching. Might be worth the time to invest in yourself for that."

They also pay decent, considering the work isn't particularly difficult."
,,Nice_Letterhead4460,,,,,"  I've been there. Changing your way of thinking helps a lot. For instance, don't think ""Gah, I have to work today."" Think, ""I get to work today."" Be grateful that you're able to work and have a supportive family. Many people out there wish they had those blessings. I'd recommend reading the book, ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" by Norman Vincent Peale. It changed my life and even addresses worry, stress, etc.

**Quick fixes that helped as well:**

\- Get 1 or 2 roommates that you trust. I have 2 roommates in my apartment that costs around $1000 total. So we're each paying less than like $350 each. (I'm saving tons of money)

\- Get in the gym before or after work. You can get a membership at PF for $10. I don't care what anyone says, but the better you look, the better you feel. Talk about a confidence boost when you see results. The higher the confidence, the more likely you're going to get out of your comfort zone. You're also likely to have more opportunities come your way due to the new pep in your step.

\- Travel more. I was working an easy mundane job and was satisfied with life, but felt like I was wasting my days. I took my first trip on an airplane to Vegas at 28 years old. Seeing a different environment & atmosphere really changed how I see the world. It gave me new life & inspiration to follow my dreams.

I get the family thing, but sometimes you have to spread your wings and see new sights & cultures to find out who you are and where you fit best. I'm not saying move away forever, but maybe try moving to a new spot with a fresh start. Give it a year, and if you hate it, you can always move back. Or just take a few trips every year and experience the world. I'm sure your family will support any decision you make.

I'm a big family guy myself. My whole family has lived within like a 50 mile radius for years. I know when I move, my family will miss me, but I figured out what I want to do with my life, and that's the move I have to make to achieve my dreams. Along with family, I believe your purpose in life is one of the most important things in life we have to figure out.

Also - don't beat yourself up too much about your situation. You're 20, have 3k to your name, and work your butt off. I'm telling you...most 20 year olds today definitely DO NOT have that type of work ethic and willpower. Hold your head high and give yourself credit for that man! When I was 20, I had no money, was living with my mom, and had no motivation to pursue anything.

Disclaimer: I am not a recruiter or anything like that. I have a child your age, and gave similar advice, which wasn't followed because she ended up getting a scholarship. I am retired Army, and I know exactly what it's like to serve. Therefore, I heartily recommend joining either the Air Guard, Coast Guard, or Space Force instead of the other services.

And I don‚Äôt have a degree in eCommerce or entrepreneurship. You are far more educationally equipped to find money out there than us. And if you‚Äôre not, then what the hell are you staying in school for? And if you got a full ride, you must have been smart‚Ä¶ so why the hell did you major in something like entrepreneuriship instead of something like IT, business, or architecture? Or nursing? 

You will never EVER slave-wage your way out of wage-slavery. But youre 20 years old bro. What the fuck are you even doing this for? Work until your lease ends, sell your car, take your $3k and spend 3 months in Thailand or Vietnam or Mexico or something. Why bother toiling like this? Why do this to yourself?

>inb4 it‚Äôs bad for your future to spend 3 months with no income vacationing 

No it literally is not, especially if you‚Äôre a very thoughtless 20 year old 

>inb4 not everyone can travel 

But everyone can wage slave? 

>inb4 wage slave is a bad word 

That‚Äôs literally what OP is describing 

>inb4 escapism isn‚Äôt good 

So just toil away hopelessly forever? Going to some place like Cambodia or Nicaragua can really open your worldview and show you some very serious and very important lessons on opportunity, poverty, resilience, travel, languages and more.

I agree with what the other response said... stay there a while, learn the skills, and then move into something that pays more. Limitless options for digital marketing careers in HVAC."
,,VegasBiDaddy,,,,,"Have you ever used facetime or zoom? You can keep in touch with them. I mean you're an e-commerce guy, you should be able to do that. And it doesn't sound pathetic. Also you're only 20 years old. You're not supposed to have it all figured out. But I do agree with people who say that you should consider relocating. Florida is a tough place to get started as a young man. The rents are out of sync with the income. You might consider a job that also gets tips. I know people where I live in Las Vegas that make triple their hourly in tips."

Plus it‚Äôs another skill to put on the resume."

,,sudden_moves,,,,,"I hear you, but it‚Äôs not all or nothing. There are countless actionable steps that cost nothing or close to nothing that can both get you started, occupy whatever free time you have, and further illuminate options and potential opportunities. 

Pretty much any entrepreneurial direction you could go in, you‚Äôre going to need significant market research as well as a fully developed business plan. This will likely be free or really cheap to you, and will require little more than your time, your ideas, and your brain. 

If you have an idea worth investing 3k in, great! However, considering how important that 3k is to your overall finances, why not investigate the hell out of that idea (for free/cheap), develop a plan and research ways that will best protect your investment, and take your time in all of this, all while saving as much as you can from your 9-5.

,,AhhUba,,,,,"Might just be a me thing, but it's hard to read huge paragraphs. That said, your right it's just reddit. 

I didn't go to college, I can't even divide on paper. I cheated all the way through highschool and graduated with a 2.5 GPA.

Consider trade school. I was a CNC machinist for 7 yrs and made great money and eventually swapped my blue collar for a white one. Now I make great money working from home a few hrs a day. Boomers hold a lot of the trade jobs and are reaching retirement. I might go back to trade work in a few years because the wages will be astronomical. 

At the very least it's a 40 hr work week that will net you the same money with 1 job. 

Last think I will say is you are young. Things take time. When I was your age I was way less disciplined and in time, wealth and success has a way of finding people that keep their nose to the grindstone."

,,Le_woulfe,,,,,"Mon Capitan - four quick tips...\*Uno\* Spend 60 minutes - today - perusing the job postings on [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com); I believe they still offer some sort of 'quick apply,' where you pretty much just select 'Apply Now' (or something of the sort), and your resume is automatically submitted to that poster - you'd be surprised how many positions you can apply for in a short amount of time.   
\*Two\* Apply to any and everything - qualified/interested/relevant to your experience and schooling or not - doesn't matter, because you literally have nothing to lose. For all you know, So and So over at That One Company might actually catch a glimpse of your info and think 'great googly moogly - this kid would be perfect for that new position Johnny Donuts proposed in last week's Corporate BS Meeting.'  
\*Threeve\* Certain decisions really do fall under the whole 'don't knock it 'til you try it' philosophy. I know plenty of folks who have shifted from one industry to another - the latter often being one that they previously swore off and, unfortunately, its most often that of the Construction industry; far too often, people subscribe to the antiquated 'that's not a real job' mindset, somehow. Especially if you are someone experiencing bouts of depression and anxiety - or someone with such a condition that is amplified due to use of the cell phone/inactivity/hopping on the PC...well, it's pretty hard to focus on something like that when you're making a physical and mental effort to accomplish a task (even if you're just pushing a garsh danged broom...as I learned years ago).   
\*Lastly\* apply for a job with literally any trade outfit, and once hired, quit your other jobs. You can always find similar gigs if you discover that pretending you're Samurai Jack while swinging a crowbar, full-force at a Plaster wall isn't for you \*this would most often be the line of work associated with Demolition, fyi...)."

,,malzoraczek,,,,,"I don't know every program out there, but all the people with PhD I know did indeed get paid for their work and did not pay for the degree. That's how it works. You can go through med school for free if you're willing to go for MD PhD, it takes more than 10 years but you finish debt free. But I only worked with people with chem/physics/math/life sciences/geosciences or material science degrees. You get the positions as Research Assistant and the PI (professor you work for) pays you a salary from the research grant. Your work is the research for the thesis, usually 40+ hours a week for about 35k-40k a year at this point (in my uni), but there are grant/awards/scholarships that can supplement that. If you are from a minority group there are special scholarships too. I had to be a TA for a year in my program, so I was teaching undergrads and being paid for that, not all programs work like that. Some require teaching through whole degree (math in my uni), some require teaching (unpaid) and research (paid), some only require research. If that's something you would be interested in, I suggest to check it out. 

And before anyone says it - if you can get a college degree you can get a PhD. It really doesn't require being a genius, all you need is motivation. Not even interest in the subject matter is necessary :)"

Look, you have the experience, the drive, and the talent. In my opinion, the hiring process is 100 times more  unfair than in the past. In our parents time, they put their resume and cover letter in a mailbox and waited to be called in for an interview. Today we deal with hiring platforms that automatically disqualify our application before anyone even reads your name. And nothing is clear anymore-- I was asked to ""have a chat"" over Zoom. Is that an interview? Is it just a meet n greet? Nothing is for sure. And when they don't end up selecting you, after all your resume tweaking, these ""chats"", hours of cover letter writing (I even wrote essays in addition to a cover letter for one position) they often don't even give you closure with a rejection email.

That being said, don‚Äôt lie if you have to do a background check or are specifically asked, but I would leave it off your resume.

Over the years I've been able to target my preferred profession to finance, but there are so many paths that I find my self wanting to explore all of my options with fears of being too specialized or boxed in. 

If I can offer any help to you, it would be to try to combine each area of each job that you liked and think of a career that looks like that. Off the top of my head you look like you'd be good in digital marketing, social media, or even some sort of business development for a non profit. The teaching portion that interests you can serve you well further down your career if you're interested in training/ managing other employees. In addition, if you like doing different things/ wearing multiple hats, try out a smaller / newer company. The roles at smaller companies usually evolve with the person, and can help you get exposed to different things you'll either love or hate. As you grow within the company you'll hopefully be able to keep doing most of the things you love and be able to ""grow beyond"" the things you don't like doing."

Yes it does come with its stresses if the patient falls or has a stroke or cardiac arrest or abnormal vitals (but that rarely happens). Pretty straight forward otherwise.

,,alexhoncharenko,,,,,"It‚Äôs unfortunate that mental health is not discussed very often through the lens of attempting to build up a career (or a small business, or a side hustle, or literally anything else). 

Any new goal, be it personal or professional will always come with a fair bit of stress. But when that stress is added on top of other significant stressors (financial hardships, mental health conditions, etc‚Ä¶), it‚Äôs all too easy to fall into a cycle of negative thought and become paralyzed. 

For anyone that feels lost or confused about what their next career step should be, this is what I would recommend:

First, make sure you have at least one form of consistent income that can keep you afloat from month to month. It‚Äôs much harder to make a good long-term decision from a place of desperation. 

Second, when you don‚Äôt know which direction to go in - any direction is the right one! Start reading books and watching YT videos about careers you‚Äôd like to try out, find out what skills are necessary to succeed in those careers, and start to teach yourself those skills through books, courses, etc. 

Start small. Break things down into the tiniest steps possible. If reading 10 pages a day is too hard, start with 2 pages per day. If watching 2 hours of courses a day is too hard, start with 20 minutes per day. 

Achieving small goals creates the dopamine necessary to achieve large goals.

,,monied17,,,,,"I wanted to quickly jump on here to share my experience.

I started dancing formally at 18.  I have only ever danced informally at high school dances or choreography for a musical. In college, I took some one-credit dance classes for fun. There was a Ballroom Dance Company on campus that looked interesting.  I auditioned and I made the cut. I have no dancing background like the other women on the company who have been doing jazz/tap/ballet since the age of two. The next several years led to dance competitions, joining dance clubs on campus (I transferred to another school), social dancing and eventually teaching Ballroom for my university. The point is, if you have a desire or a burning passion for something that you have yet to do, go for it. You won't know if you're any good or if you truly enjoy doing something until you try.  Also, you are NEVER too old to start something (unless the law says so like joining the military lol). 

&#x200B;

My other piece of advice is to study something that you truly enjoy doing. I was initially a Dietetics and Food Science major. I changed majors and added two minors in my last semester of schooling. It was worth it to stay in college a few more years pursuing what I wanted to do than be miserable with my career choice for the next 40-60 years."

If you have ruled it out, maybe start by thinking about what are the aspects of music that you like and dislike.  The practice?  The performance?  The theory side?

I've been studying web(full stack), game, blockchain, smart contract - etc. development online since February living off of my savings.

When people do become successful, it can involve a lot of traveling and a headache of contracts and everything, and I don't think I have enough passion to want to commit to even the steps leading up to that (see next paragraph). In contrast, getting some other degree that is high in demand will always provide opportunities for stable and lucrative positions.

I didn't go into much detail about every reason I don't want to pursue music anymore, but I have had a dwindling passion for performance, in small part because of how much more expectation there is to be technically brilliant over musically expressive.

,,marstheruler,,,,,"Most highly skilled jobs (medicine, tech, etc) will get you 6 figures as a part time consultant. The work and time it takes to reach that level is often considerable though, so how much are you willing to invest?

Trades that offer this lifestyle also require varying levels of upfront time commitments, and while you may only work 20 hours/week you might not get to choose which 20 hours you work (ie plumbing) or it might be the 20 hours that everyone else is usually free (ie any job in entertainment)."
,,,,,,,"How old are you? How intelligent are you? How's your physical fitness?

Most high paying jobs do have high requirements. Trade jobs require you to be the CEO of your company to earn well. That means bureaucracy: accounting, taxes, marketing and the list goes on. 

You want to be a comfortable manager or individual contributor? Well, get ready to put in the years. Nobody is going to pay a fresh graduate with BA degree 6 figures. You put in the years either in academia or at work, but in most cases you need at least of 5 years of grinding.

Generally speaking there are a few jobs that has low entry requirements, tons of free time and high income potential, mostly sales roles in luxury segment. Selling yachts, sports cars, luxury watches and other high end products have high commission. But you need connections and passion for the product. You never sell a car if you are not a good driver and a gearhead. You'll never sell luxury watches well if you have no understanding and appreciation for the craftsmanship.

There is no quick rich solution. You must put in the time to get the desired results.

One alternative if you are morally ambiguous: being a fixer for grey area corporate work. Busting unions, targeting lawsuit witnesses, forcing out indigenous people from their land with sabotage and private military to build a factory on their land. Burning down villages to get access to mines. Corporate sabotage is very well paying, but usually requires the military route, you need to serve a few years, sign up for special forces and do highly dangerous and controversial missions to get your foot in the door. 

You work 3-8 months a year and love like a small king."
,,Scarface74,,,,,"Money has bought my wife and I plenty of time:

- I pay a lawn service so I can spend time doing what I enjoy.

- my job is WFH and with my wife being retired, I can skip out during the middle of the day and hang out and work later.

,,Scarface74,,,,,Cloud Consulting. I am full time employee for the consulting department of a well known tech company. It isn‚Äôt hard to figure out which one. Check out my comment history.
,,iwillshampooyouitsok,,,,,That's the first thing you need to learn. The jobs people want to do pay less. Except for the jobs that no one wants to do. Those pay even less and the pay is one reason why nobody wants to do them lol. Don't ever give up on a dream though. Maybe you'll never be a rich oil painter but that doesn't mean you shouldn't go to art school and learn design. You can become a middle class designer and end up very happy.

,,GiddyDriver,,,,,"Yes, very common. How many people can decide at 18 or so for their career path. I wonder if it would be beneficial for people to take a couple of years out from school to work/travel before going on to a degree path."
,,nanakapow,,,,,"Totally normal.

Forensics is a great example. In the UK, every year students graduating with a forensics degree outweigh the total number of people working in the forensics field. The vast majority won't end up working in forensics, departments aren't growing much, and retirement isn't opening up that many roles. Most will just have to do something else.

Another way of looking at this is that as an adult, you'd be mental to let an 18 year old plan your life. Yet that's when most people make their decisions about their degrees etc."

Find out what problems need to be solved -- and/or come up with ways to help. One idea, discover what stories need to be shared on social media to help drive results. Ie. Recruiting issues?

,,motherofminipanthers,,,,,"You‚Äôve only been there for 3 months but these things happen. I‚Äôd be honest and say a former manager reached out with an opening at their company and it‚Äôs going to be a better fit for your career goals. I wouldn‚Äôt specifically say because it pays more but that overall it‚Äôs going to be a better fit for your needs. If they specifically ask if it‚Äôs about pay, you can say that they are offering more but there are other factors at play - the ability to work from home, career growth etc. if it was just about pay, your current company might ask if they can offer you more money to stay. 

I know these conversations can be stressful but you have to do what‚Äôs best for you! Congrats on the new job offer and good luck."
,,mycatisacunt____,,,,,"Yes, I am currently an employer for staff of a warehouse and a lot of the time people leave without reason. When they leave and give us a fake reason we can always tell that they‚Äôre lying, it‚Äôs the same excuses over and over. I had one bloke come in the other day and said he wants to hand in his notice because he‚Äôs been offered a job that is more hours and better pay. What advice I would give you though is wait until they ask why you‚Äôre leaving before you tell them why because otherwise it might sound like you are telling them you have a job with better pay to see if they‚Äôll offer you more money first. Good luck with your new job! Just be polite and in your letter of notice tell them thank you for the opportunities they have given you :)"

5. Sort of, I have plenty of mechanical experience as well as certifications. I have diesel mechanic experience and vocation schooling through the Military, I have aerospace composites fabrication work experience as well as certifications.

Plus plenty of overtime available. Regular workers make about 4 dollars less than a lead. And supervisors make pretty darn close to 100k and all that requires is experience, schooling is encouraged but not required."
,,pobrefauno,,,,,"I started as a wg5 employee and moved up to a wg10 employee in 1 year, then 3 years later got promoted to a Wl10 (current). In dollar amount per hour it was roughly, 16, 21, 25, 27 the first year. Then from my promotion I went from 27.51 to 29 an hr. Add 7.5% differential and that puts me a 31.26 per hour. The amount that takes me over 70k/yearly comes from a combination of overtime, which I do a little, and my reservist income, even though they're separate entities. 

Once this other adjustment takes place my max potential will go from 35 to 37.10 an hour, which is amazing imo."

6. It is related to my degree because I am Computer Science major.

3. Didn‚Äôt seek any specific job title. In my industry,  all new people get the same title. Sought out a position for about two weeks

4. Does internship period count? Took a week to land the internship, but I was in school so I interned a year and a half before hiring full time

5. Yes, all construction management

6. Talked to people at a career fair and grabbed drinks after. They called it an interview after the fact and hired me on. I had 0 experience, but I was friendly and willing to learn

They applied and got selected and waited for their background investigation, some waited up to a year to be cleared to work. But the whole time they waited they worked on unclassified programs. 

There is a lot of stigma of working for the government, it comes with a lot of politics sometimes. But it is a solid career with great benefits, and guaranteed wages. This whole covid thing hasn't affected me in the slightest, except my tsp is benefitting from the low market prices."

,,alcohall183,,,,,"don't be discouraged. there are many people that fill out 1000's of applications and get a handful of interviews. The best way to get a job now, seems that you need to be extremely specific on every job application and resume.

,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"Don't give up! I am in the marketing field and there are so many places and roles that fall within that role. 

I did end up getting a job through Indeed, but I have also seen many people land it through LinkedIn. 

My advice is to apply for jobs through those two platforms. Before you send in your resume target it to that specific company and role. Making sure to use their vocabulary. You might also have a chance if you apply for a marketing internship at the beginning. 

The thing that has helped me so much is that after I send in an application I go look up the company and the staff. I will find the person who posted the job and reach out to them and let them know I applied.

Sometimes before I even apply to a company I will follow them on LI in order to get notification of when they post a new job right away. Before they even post anything I start networking with people in their marketing team. Once the job is open I will feel more comfortable asking them for a referral or tips on how to get hired. 

You can also share your marketing knowledge on LI and start creating a portfolio of projects you can share when interviewed.

,,Big-Abbreviations-50,,,,,"I don‚Äôt know if that is something that can necessarily be ascertained without seeing the company and meeting people in person. And I like metrics! But it‚Äôs more of a personal connection, and is difficult to explain. For me it‚Äôs about looking someone in the eyes, seeing their mannerisms (are they tense or relaxed?), and seeing whether the conversation ‚Äúflows‚Äù or not (do they laugh and occasionally chat about non-work-related things in a NON-forced manner?).

It‚Äôs just as, if not more, about how you connect with the person you‚Äôre interviewing with than strictly about your qualifications (not that qualifications aren‚Äôt important, but ‚Äúor‚Äù options are often considered; e.g., degree or equivalent experience). I also would look at the other people at the company ‚Ä¶ do they seem relaxed and genuinely happy, or stressed and anxious?

Connection and company culture match are so important, not only for getting your foot in the door but also for moving up ‚Äî but moving up requires making yourself seem and heard, as well as doing excellent work and being known as one of the top performers. It also requires taking on projects of your own volition; that sets you apart from others. If you just do what‚Äôs assigned to you and everyone else day in and day out and few people outside your department know who you are, it‚Äôs unlikely that you will get promoted. I‚Äôve always jumped on and volunteered for things I was passionate about.

ETA: And you don‚Äôt want to emphasize your qualifications to the point that the person interviewing you to whom you‚Äôd be reporting might feel as though you‚Äôd be competing for THEIR job. If that happens, then the consideration for you might just stop there ‚Äî regardless of how perfect you may be for the position. Of course, you should talk about ALL your qualifications, but balance it out with emphasis on how you want to help the team achieve your (say ‚Äúour‚Äù) goals."

,,rave_master555,,,,,"I do not think that any job is truly safe from recession. However, public sector jobs tend to have the best job security and protection in the job market. Once you pass the probationary period, you cannot just be fired as long as your title is an official position from the civil service commission. For example, I have been working for my state Department of Labor (DOL) for over three years. I have passed my initial probationary period (which was four months) as a trainee in the Division of Wage and Hour (WHD). 

After one year in my trainee title, I got automatically promoted to field investigator. Recently this year, I got a lateral promotion to title Investigator 2 in the HR Division. Even if I fail the probationary period or the Civil service exam for the title Investigator 2, I would just go back to my permanent title as a field investigator in WHD. My union protects me from my employer, and not only provides representation, but also a lawyer if needed. The contract my union made with my state protected all local and state workers from being fired or laid off during and after the lockdown.

Even during the lockdown, I still kept receiving my annual step increments, kept my state health insurance, pension, union perks, etc., and still received cost of living raises (they were just pushed to be reflected at a later date). The lockdown is the reason why my state started a pilot telework program for state workers (I am hoping it will become a permanent option for us). Plenty of people in the private sector lost their job though (including six-figure jobs). I do not make anywhere near $100k a year, but I am glad that I kept my job and was able to get a decent promotiom this year (just hoping I can pass the civil service exam so that I can become permanent in my title and get to keep it too)."

No, they aren't! They just aren't around you - like in your family, the family of engineers! :)))

  
It's a little hard to know of all the language/art/writing jobs in the world when all the ppl round you are in a limited set of completely opposite careers. Recommend you find yourself a career consultant in your area, join a program that helps you switch career tracks, take writing/art/language based classes in your nearby college at night or whatever you might have available, join online programs that teach the same, whatever you can do to dip your toes into some new waters and wade through to whatever areas seem the most interesting of the moment! Follow the dopamine in this case, it'll lead you to what you want to be doing. However you can do it...figure out a way to make it work!

  
Note: I am a career consultant myself but this is my field of expertise. There are whole million-dollar career consulting companies, courses (college or other) that are totally set up for situations like yours! They are set up to help people change career tracks and THAT is how rich people change career tracks on a whim."

I was in your exact position at 17.

Look, that feeling of wanting to try and walk down many paths will never leave you if you‚Äôre a curious person.

At 25, I‚Äôve made good money in sales, worked for an extremely famous sales trainer as a business coach, and now work at a marketing agency. 

I also took 7 years to get my bachelors, but I have 0 debt owed and worked for very cool companies throughout the way, becoming self sufficient, traveling, and buying the cool things I never had growing up with my big boy money.

My advice to you is to not go in debt for college.

Go to a 2 year community college (very cheap) because the reality is you‚Äôre very young and you may hop around a bunch.

This will allow you to not go in debt and the workload will be easy enough for you to get a full time job/internship.

You like working on computers? 

Look for an internship doing this early on.

Or maybe find a job to pay some bills while you study computer science at a community college before transferring your credits to a university.

TL;DR: This is an extremely personal decision, but my advice is this: get a job/internship for immediate experience, go to a community college, transfer to a university, and try to build your career/experience as early and as fast as possible. Just do not go into debt so early on.

When you untangle the knots of conditioning, remove the labels you bought into, clarity will come.  People think this is a longer, harder road- it is not.  Best to you... you will find your way."
,,CharlieSinclaire,,,,,"If you can, I recommend learning to code even if that isn't necessarily what you want to do. I got my undergrad in systems programming and ended up working as a buyer in the business field. The thing is, even though I don't necessarily code for my job, the lessons I learned from that degree have helped me with every endeavor since. It teaches you critical thinking, problem solving, time management, organization and how to explain complex problems to people (or machines) at a basic level. Those skills can be applied anywhere and to anything."

,,CharlieSinclaire,,,,,"Instead of going to a university full time maybe see if your local community college has coding classes available? You can learn some good skills, get some hands on help with things you don't understand and not end up in massive amounts of debt.

 If not, then you still have resume items and new skills you can apply to whatever career path you choose."

How do I get a job at Pixar?,ho96zl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ho96zl/how_do_i_get_a_job_at_pixar/,9,8,1594321767.0,
,,mokenz,,,,,Go to CalArts to be honest
,,Icious_,,,,,"I don't have any experiences with it, but I'll give you my 2 cents. I think Pixar is a really hard job to get into because everyone wants to work there. You need to build a portfolio of the skills you listed by practicing and working with clients. You can do freelance work by looking on Craigslist or where ever. You can get a Animation degree at a college where they teach you all those things to better your skills and learn from professors. I've seen students from Academy of Art University get jobs at Pixar. You can apply to internships that Pixar offers or any animation/art companies.

You need to start learning how to use programs, such as Adobe Suite programs and other animation/art programs. There's plenty of YouTube videos to start learning.

You're not going to get a job at Pixar right after High School. It's going to be a long, hard road to get to your dream job."
,,poached-egg-gang,,,,,"What do you want to do at Pixar? If you want to animate, you gotta be very talented, preferably with exp at a different studio or Disney animatoon. Or go thru Disney's Professional Internship program as a talented student (will need prof experience to even be considered for the internship too). 

You'll probably find better inroads if you're open to other career paths at Pixar, there are plenty on the business, entertainment, mkting side.

,,marstheruler,,,,,"Since you don‚Äôt have a specific job in mind I might focus on learning more about the company culture, what they look for in candidates, etc. you might read Creativity, Inc which is about how Pixar works from a corporate side.

Also, if there‚Äôs someone specific at Pixar you admire you should reach out to them and ask for an informational interview. As someone who gets cold emails from people who eventually want my job, or might, a thoughtful well written message usually gets a little bit of my time for free.

While skills are a given at companies like Pixar, they are usually not the only or most important thing you need."

,,mjs_jr,,,,,"Some suggestions:

- how did you get started?
- what was your first job at Disney like?
- what was your most difficult or challenging role and why?
- if you could go back in time, what advice would you give yourself when starting out?
- what has your career path looked like and did any of it surprise you?
- how have you gone about identifying mentors?
- if you‚Äôve see my resume/background, do you have any suggestions for me? (On the job hunt or positions to look for or places to work)

And one piece of practical advice: when you have the phone call, do it standing up.  I got that advice YEARS ago.  You sound more focused and energetic than when lounging in a chair.  And smile when you can (unforced) - I swear you can hear the pleasant tone of a smiling person on the other end of the phone."
,,Adorable_Pug,,,,,"I would be honest and at some point in the conversation mention that you're nervous, its fine were human. That being said, prepare! Create a list of questions, and force youself to smile a lot during the conversation, itll improve your tone a lot!"

He's a human, just like 30 years older maybe. He's not a god, he's not someone to look up to - yet. You're also a human, a bit younger, just asking some questions about a possible career you're looking into. Random stranger to random stranger."
,,aceshighsays,,,,,"i'm curious, what medium did you use to contact him? what was your subject line?"
,,,,,,,"Whenever I have a big call with a client I like to plan ahead with not only questions but overall structure. 

I plan the call to have a complete structure: beginning, middle, and end. 

I also think about four factors for the client: what are their goals and challenges personally, what are their goals and challenges professionally, how does this contribute to the success of their company, what factors are there in the industry that affects them such as new technology, regulation, etc. If you can structure your questions with these in mind it will give you a complete picture of the individual, show you care,  and help you ask solid questions. 

I think about what I‚Äôll open with in the beginning, remind myself to thank them, ask minor personal questions like how the quarantine is going or if they‚Äôve been staying busy. Just basic small talk to warm up the conversation. If you‚Äôre in the same field you may even tell a little joke or make a funny reference to something you both may know about. Doesn‚Äôt need to be a knock knock joke or standup routine. If it falls flat, which has happened to me many times, just keep going. Most people will appreciate you at least trying to break the monotony of the work day and you‚Äôll be remembered.

For the body, here‚Äôs where you can ask your questions. It can be tough to not sound like a reporter asking questions when you have a list so if something peaks your interest ask more, if you have had a similar experience don‚Äôt be afraid to briefly share it. In asking follow up questions on the spot, think about the four factors mentioned above as you shape your questions. 

For the end of the call, summarize the important points, mention anything you need to follow up on or research, and then thank them for their time. Remember your time is important too so you don‚Äôt have to be ever grateful,  just respectful and polite. 

If you have anything significant left over to follow up on, especially as it relates to the four factors use this as a tool to reach back out via email and start to slowly over the course of weeks and months form a relationship. 

If you don‚Äôt vibe with the person you don‚Äôt have to attempt to form a relationship. Entirely up to you."

,,ddmnh,,,,,I'm a corporate recruiter.  Sadly many managers think the person they don't know **must** be better than internal talent.  The external candidate nobody knows their baggage or deficiencies; the internal person they know everything.  They then focus on the negative.   Start floating your resume see what happens.
,,paz_vegas,,,,,Seems like they have made up their mind about you and it's sad but the reality -it's always about who they like and choose to promote. If you feel strongly enough about this and have done all you can and don't want more disappointment. I think you know what to do.

,,blueopera,,,,,"I don't know you other than what you've written for us, but I can share some experiences and my perspective as a manager.  I have had a few employees over the years who work hard but are not the individuals I strongly consider for promotions.  Unfortunately for them, it's largely because of an attitude/motivation issue.  Their primary interest has been in getting promoted and they have generally had an attitude of superiority and defensiveness about how hard they work and what they contribute.  They bring up how much they deserve a promotion and demand to know what they need to do in order to get promoted next time.  In contrast, the individuals I have promoted also do their work, but they are strong critical thinkers, problem solvers, and seek to improve their work to benefit their clients and push us closer to our vision.  They show vulnerability and seek guidance from me on how they can improve, and seek my input on how they can refine their work output for better results.  Perhaps they have an underlying desire to be promoted, but that is not front and center.  What I see is their steadfast commitment to the work they do.  They tend to be slightly surprised, humble, and grateful when they are promoted.

Again, I have not worked with you so I'm not sure if this mirrors your experience at all, but I thought this perspective might be helpful."
,,dejazz367,,,,,"too important to be promoted?
what does that mean?"
,,NTDP1994,,,,,"It means they have given many tasks they themselves don't want to take so you're important as the fall man to do them. They won't promote you in order to have someone do those tasks and that already knows how, without the hassle of finding someone else to do them."
,,dejazz367,,,,,"yes, and may i know why am i singled out as the person who pick these scraps?"
,,NTDP1994,,,,,"Man (or woman), I don't know, I'm not your boss.

But this kind of things do happen. They get someone that, through time, started doing all the menial and specific things and, in a way, that person becomes too valuable in that position to move somewhere else.

If you want my advice, you should, as suggested above, start interviewing elsewhere, but, in the meantime, make sure that you are the only one who truly knows how to do the bullshit tasks, make sure you're irreplaceable. 

Then, when you get another offer, leave them burn or make them give you a higher promotion."
Best careers for someone with social anxiety?,dsz5qr,Morgs1125,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/dsz5qr/best_careers_for_someone_with_social_anxiety/,10,8,1573139965.0,
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"I'd work on the social anxiety rather than be limited by it.  I'm not a medical expert by any means but surely even ""severe"" social anxiety can be treated and improved?"
,,ourmajorconfusion,,,,,"What skills do you have? What do you enjoy doing? And then start googling for careers that have the intersection of both. 
If u find a few interesting options, find ppl on LinkedIn, community anywhere to ask them how their life looks like and see if that‚Äôs something you would do. Through that maybe an opportunity comes up as well.

The reason is it‚Äôs hard to say which career suit you because ppl with social anxiety are averse to different things. So ppl might‚Äôve assumed u may never have wanted to be part of a band or cheerleading. You‚Äôre the only person who has the best filter goggles on. You just need to msg more ppl and research what is out there."
,,joyce_emily,,,,,"You're coming from the right place asking this, because you definitely want to play to your strengths. But your anxiety doesn't define you and it can't pick a job for you. I would instead make a list of positions that you know wouldn't work- anything that's micromanaged, anything high stress, and anything that would require you to deal with very angry or upset people on a regular basis (like human or social services). 

Since you say you've been diagnosed, I assume you're being treated by someone. Have them help you draw up list of strengths and triggers that you can use with an advisor or career coach to look at potential jobs. And don't be afraid to go after your passion! Even if you think it will stress you out, you may surprise yourself."
,,chillin014,,,,,"Smart of you to be thinking about this before committing to something in college unlike so many of us. There are so many unknowns that make choosing the ""right"" path difficult. I read a lot of posts clearly from other people working in corporate america and while I'm sure most of us sit in a cubicle all day,  our day-to-day can be very different. I think one resounding factor that impacts ANY job in ANY field or industry is who your boss is. The bad news is - you can rarely chose your boss (although sometimes you can get an idea during interviews). The good news is, you can always move onto another role or another company. 

Sorry I don't have more specific advice but I've had all kinds of bosses and like you- the ones that left me alone to do my work in peace were my favorite. I've certainly been micro-managed as well but it has all been part of the learning and growing process. Even as someone who picked a field with narrow-minded logic I don't look around today and worry that I could have made a significantly better decision. Perhaps not relevant to your question but everyone I know who went the traditional path ended up more-or-less in an office building behind a computer. But that's partly because of the dominate industry here in Houston.

More on topic- I don't think you can go wrong in an engineering field. Opportunities are limitless across many industries and regions. Accounting also pays well and you can build a whole career around it. Every company has an accounting department.  I've also heard a-lot of great things about tech jobs (software engineering, etc) but admittedly I know nothing about it. These are ""hard"" skills you learn in college. Stay away from soft degrees like psychology, social sciences, etc."

This is actually been called Bullshit jobs in a book and has been thoroughly investigated. You can also check out the authors public lectures.

I sit in a cubicle 8 hours a day and last week my proudest accomplishment was affixing an umbrella on the shelf above my head to block the fluorescent lighting glare which was causing my eyes to fatigue.

Like you I am constantly wondering who of my peers is truly feeling a sense of purpose, making a difference, and how I can also have that. As far as I can tell most everyone is just going through the motions, trying to pay bills, and, at least in a corporate environment, their impact is likely a drop in the bucket.

You're a chef, which sounds exotic and cool to me. You produce something that has a tangible and direct impact on people who are not far removed from you. I say do it as long as you enjoy it/it makes sense for you."

I'm 27 now, but when I was 23 cooking took me internationally, as it is something you can do anywhere. Cook for your friends, learn to present food artfully, be visually proud of what you do. 

Also if you want to cook, find a restaurant with a menu you'd be proud to cook."
,,,,,,,"No.

Let me elaborate.

&#x200B;

I work in a global tech company, in a senior management role (that I managed to retain in the last restructure, together with 10% pay increase). Company culture is not that great but money and perks make it worthwhile. 

The work that my team does is important to our customers...consumer and commercial/enterprise/government. 

&#x200B;

BUT

&#x200B;

After my daughter's passing, I no longer see my work as something important because I don't directly do anything to help people where it counts. To overcome my feeling of uselessness, I volunteer quite a bit with underprivileged, sick, new migrants, etc.

If I was not so dependent (or accustomed?!)  to the income/perks of my current job, I'd probably go into psychology or counselling."

To me, this article represents millennials and their endless meetings along with group think. It's all fluff no work. I do care about making a difference. But I just don't see a pencil pusher making huge world changes so a lot of it I can't take seriously. Millenials' just like the sound of their own voice basically.  I really don't need to beg the guy driving a Mercedes to tell me I'm making a difference, I can infer based on my daily activities whether or not I am.

By not giving a proper notice, sometimes company policy, you are not re-hireable, thus would be similar to being fired."
,,ItHappensIn3s,,,,,"Give two and make sure your new job knows it.  They would appreciate the same professional courtesy, and it'd be a red flag if you appear willing to leave an employer high and dry."
,,mcgaur044,,,,,"It appears that you're currently facing a complex situation, trying to find equilibrium among your career aspirations, financial considerations, and your rapport with your boss. Given your unique circumstances, it's crucial to thoroughly evaluate your choices.  
  
On one hand, extending your notice period to two weeks might result in relinquishing your bonus ‚Äì a valid concern. On the other hand, opting for a one-week notice would ensure you receive your bonus, but it could potentially influence your connection with your boss and how the company perceives your commitment.  
  
Considering the industry's small size and the potential for future collaborations with your boss, maintaining a positive professional rapport holds significance. Nevertheless, it's equally important to prioritize your career growth and alignment.  
  
Your proactive approach in contemplating potential outcomes, including your boss's potential support, is commendable. If you find that the new offer genuinely aligns with your long-term objectives and offers better prospects, this should certainly factor into your decision-making.  
  
Before finalizing your choice, consider engaging in an open and candid conversation with your boss. Express your gratitude for the opportunities provided and your quandary regarding the notice period. This conversation could help you gauge your boss's response and ascertain if there's any room for negotiation or finding middle ground.  
  
Ultimately, the decision you make should harmonize with what you believe will serve your career trajectory best. Achieving the right equilibrium between financial gain and preserving professional connections is intricate, and it's a judgment that ultimately hinges on your aspirations and values."
,,TerribleTodd60,,,,,"There is nothing worth more than your reputation.  I don't know how much the bonus is but put yourself in the company's shoes you are leaving.  Cutting your notice to one week to take advantage of them and claim your bonus is going to color how they think about you in the future.  And I'm sure they'll share that information. 

The business world is small. Go to your boss and tell them that you are making a career move and that you are leaving.  In light of that, you don't think it would be entirely appropriate to accept your bonus.  They'll either give you the bonus anyway, or take you at your word.  Either way, the move will enhance your reputation with your current company and anyone that hears about it.  That's my two cents anyway, good luck."
,,Cacmaniac,,,,,"No, you give the standard 2 week notice. Forgot what everyone rose here is telling you to do. Previous employers may seem irrelevant to a lot of people on here, but they still have the right to give certain information about you to a future inquiring employer. You dont want to burn bridges. You don‚Äôt want a future employer thinking your a flake when they ask about your work ethic and they say you ‚Äúup and left‚Äù or even lie because they were irritated with you ‚Äúup and leaving.‚Äù
Give the standard 2 weeks notice. If they decide to fire you for some reason; that you probably had coming anyway, before then, then at least you did what was right, and can probably still get the new job quicker. But you don‚Äôt want to leave suddenly and then get a bad rep."
,,Pleasant_Spell_3682,,,,,I would at least. Don't burn bridges
,,Conscious-Tip-3896,,,,,"At my first corporate job, I gave my 2-week notice and they ended my employment later that same day. That was the first and only time I‚Äôve given 2 weeks. Get your bonus, give a week‚Äôs notice, and best of luck in your new role.

,,Pale-Connection726,,,,,Ask yourself if they would give you 1 week notice before they fired you? Thats your answer

,,Effective_Job_4492,,,,,"Do what is best for you.  You don't really owe them more.  Give them a week.  If they ask for more, tell them you can't afford to lose you bonus.  If they want you longer then can easily pay your bonus."
,,TheResumeBar,,,,,"It's clear that you are considering your options thoughtfully and seeking the best path forward for both your career and your relationship with your current employer. The prospect of losing a bonus can be a challenging decision factor, especially when financial considerations are significant.

Here's a suggestion that might offer a balanced approach. We recommend having an open and honest conversation with your current boss about your situation. Share your excitement about the offer aligned with your career path and explain the dilemma regarding the bonus and the two-week notice period. You might be pleasantly surprised by their understanding and willingness to accommodate your situation.

In such conversations, it could be worth discussing the possibility of working a one-week notice while using accrued vacation or sick time for the second week. This way, you could honor your commitment to your current employer, retain your bonus, and ensure a smooth transition for everyone involved. Your team and leadership will undoubtedly appreciate your commitment to ensuring a smooth handover.

Your approach of seeking a win-win solution showcases your professionalism and shows your respect for the positive relationship you've built with your current employer. Given the industry's size and the potential for future collaborations, preserving this relationship is valuable.

If you decide to go this route, crafting a well-thought-out resignation letter can further communicate your gratitude for your time with the company and your intention to leave on good terms.

,,BeauTfulMess,,,,,Can you tell me how you get a bonus for working longer? That seems strange.
,,MasterAnnatar,,,,,I honestly think the best thing to do is just have an open conversation about it with your boss. Let them know that if it weren't for the bonus you wouldn't hesitate to give 2 weeks. If they refuse to accept one week choose the priority between not burning a bridge or the extra money.
,,Theresalinedances,,,,,One week is fine.
,,skrinklada85,,,,,"Would they give you notice if you were going to be let go? If the answer is no, I wouldn't give them two weeks. Businesses RARELY do what's in the best interests of their workforce, you have to do what is best for you."
,,PaulSNJ,,,,,"Last two jobs I left in 2018 and 2020, not only did I give zero notice, I double dipped for a week (road sales position so I could get away with it).  I did not want to quit the old job without being sure that the new job would be okay.  Never bit me in the ass, furthermore my current job pays about double what the 2018 one did.  You have to trust your gut! Oh, and the job I quit in 2020 kept my bonus, even though I completed the month and made my sales quota!  I loved the idea of leaving while on top"
,,xch13fx,,,,,"So your new employer won't award you the bonus if you put in a 2 week notice? And you are going to this new employer for 'similar offer'? 

In my honest opinion, just going on what you've said here, the new company sounds just as bad or worse than you current company. I don't really see any compelling reason to want to leave, unless you haven't given us all the details.

One last thing, you don't just 'get' promotions, you are offered them, and then you choose to accept/decline them. Not sure why you accepted a promotion when you feel it's not in-line with your career goals... and furthermore, why are you trying to leave a company that loves you and promotes you? I'm just honestly flabbergasted."
,,Monkey_Bullet,,,,,"Never a smart idea when you have to burn bridges in a small industry.  If the bonus is not a huge sum and you can afford to, I would work the 2 weeks."
,,AnonOfEmber,,,,,"One week, extra money is extra money. If you trust your boss explicitly I would just explain to them that you would miss out on a nice bonus if you give 2 weeks instead of 1 and that you really don‚Äôt want to burn this bridge but want the extra money while starting out in a new job. If you don‚Äôt trust your boss explicitly, just tell them they want you to start in a week.

TIP: Kinda depends on your industry a little bit.. Please, for the love of god, even if you‚Äôd trust your boss with your life, DON‚ÄôT tell them where you‚Äôre going. Seen too many stories about people doing that then suddenly the job they quit to get is gone."

,,twesturland15,,,,,Exactly
,,CelebrationIcy1627,,,,,I‚Äôm pretty new in my career and i feel like I forgive my bonus (not that material) I may get a great recommendation from her while If I wait for a one week she might end up not give me a recommendation.
,,JSutt771,,,,,"It's not about working longer, it's about when OP puts the notice in.  Op would still be quitting two weeks from now, but should they put notice in now and give two weeks, or put notice in next week after they get theor bonus."
,,CelebrationIcy1627,,,,,"It‚Äôs in the same industry but a different department that I want to pursue. The promotion was a little
While back, and I didn‚Äôt have an offer when I took the promotion. The new company gave me more than plenty of time to start , but I haven‚Äôt put in my two weeks because I‚Äôm debating on if the bonus is worth putting in one week. I‚Äôm actually take a small pay cut it at this new company but it aligns with being in this department. To clarify My current employer wouldn‚Äôt give me my yearly bonus if i put a two weeks in."
,,CrazyCow9978,,,,,"That‚Äôs the risk, but as I said, the employer would absolutely NOT afford any employee the same courtesy."
,,hairyconary,,,,,"This is a risk, and if it is an extreamly narrow field, you might be right, But my experience (on the other end of this) is that when great people leave, even if they leave fast, they usually leave the door open to passing on info, answering questions and providing backup support. You can make this win win for sure. ""Hey Manager, I know this is short, and I would normally like to leave two weeks, but because of the cercumstances of ths extrodinary offer, I can only give you one weeks notice. What else can I do outside of normal work hours to make the transition as smooth as possible for the company"""
,,feelin_cheesy,,,,,"Just remember, it‚Äôs not personal. The bonus is paid for time you‚Äôve already put in. If they needed to let you go, you would not get such a courtesy from them."
,,CelebrationIcy1627,,,,,Yeah your right I think if I could prepare with prep videos / instructions for any replacement it shows that I didn‚Äôt want to leave my boss stranded. Thanks for the advice

Psychology is useless without a masters degree and extra work.

,,JanetBZ,,,,,Unless you get a PhD in Psychology there's not much you can do with the degree. If you're interested in doing therapy get a social work degree (Master's level). Nurses are in really high demand so I'd be inclined to do that.
,,insert-witty-coment,,,,,"If you are considering psychology because you like that speciality and find it interesting, but are interested in nursing because you enjoy the active, hands-on care of patients, then why not work towards becoming a psychiatric nurse?

,,faithoverfear1230,,,,,"My friend has a psychology bachelors degree and it‚Äôs useless. Unless you are also planning on going for your masters/doctorate, is when I understand you can actually use it. 

I‚Äôm a nurse, turned SAHM. I worked for an insurance company prior to becoming a SAHM and I enjoyed it. There‚Äôs a lot you can do with a nursing degree. I made like $75k doing that but from what I understand travel nurses or hospital nurses who take advantage of bonuses etc can make a lot of money."
,,Forgotwhoisignedinas,,,,,"psych major here.

dont. DON'T. just, don't.

i'll tell you: it's an interesting, engaging, fantastic field. also, a BA in psych does NOT translate into anything. you wanna be a counselor? you gotta go to grad school. you want to do case management? you need a masters in social work. 

psychology was the major everyone did when they didn't know what to do. now, people do CS majors and the degree is about as useful as psych was in the 2000-2010s times: everyone has one and everyone needs more than that to get a decent job anywhere.

You can work in schools, insurance companies, work with psychiatric patients, be a case manager, so many things. Plus, the money is insanely good. You could do travel nursing after you have worked for a few years and make even more crazy money. Nursing school is a bitch, but you can also get an associates degree, which is 2 years. Having a bachelor's degree is fine, but it's not much more money."

&#x200B;

I suspect nursing would be more engaging, more impactful, and pay better than staying in the pure Psychology field... and probably more exhausting too... Most nurses I know don't recommend the field... Just like most therapists I know -\_-"
,,Exotic_Delay5308,,,,,"You should opt for psychology if you get a PhD, it's getting to be known nowadays because a lot of people have or suffering from mental health issues, so there would be a day when doctors/surgeons are just as valued as psychiatrist/psychologists. But I would like to tell you that i opted psychology in my high school and it's not an easy subject, easy doesn't exist in psychology and the theory is pretty complex like learning different names of psychologists and their theories, personality theories, society, Mental disorders, health and so many models. I can't count how many hours you'll need to learn all that, also psychology is a changing field meaning if there is any new advancements in the fields, it will change what you learn and can alter the course. The last thing about psychology I would like to say is, the test will not just be theoretical and you just have to answer everything of what you learned, they will give you a lot of twisted questions and you have to think and answer to what you learned. Overall I would say that if u like complex theory and love the abstract, opt for psychology and you'll be satisfied but if you just want a stable paycheck and reputed job, opt nursing."

,,ArborealRodent,,,,,"My suggestion: become an RN through a BSN program. Some states have community colleges with good transfer programs for nurses and decent financial aid in the forms of grants and scholarships. As long as you work closely with both the community college and university, shifting from your AA/AS degree to the BSN will be doable.

I strongly suggest the BSN because it opens the door to guaranteed employment now and future graduate-level degrees later like nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, or even a master's in social work (a much better route to counseling than just psychology). You would have a solid healthcare foundation that could be built on with endless opportunities."
,,lauradiamandis,,,,,"I got a psych degree and went back for a nursing degree at 33 because the psych degree was useless. Don‚Äôt waste your time, you‚Äôll end up waiting tables and you can do that without spending 4 years getting a degree."
,,justcutmeloose,,,,,"It will depend what you are wanting to do and which you feel is more fulfilling.
Nurses are an immediately provider, and help ""fix"" injuries that can be seen. Most cases offering more instant ""gratification"" knowing you've made a difference.

Psychology is the helping the unknown and unseen, often times not ""fixing"" an issue but helping mitigate and navigate a broad scale of mental heath issues and challenges. 

Psychology is a small field (unfortunately) often specialized into areas and categories. Which means less openings for employment because our nation's refusal to back the mental heath care field.

Nurses, you can almost find a job anywhere. Picking to be permanently in one location, or a travel nurse picking up ""contracts"" in areas you choose to work at. 
That said Nurses are constantly getting driven into the dirt because of shortages, ignorant patients and patient visitors, shortages of supplies, and many other problems. Lastly depending on the area the pay can be either great or shit."
,,cheaganvegan,,,,,I‚Äôm a nurse. Don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs awful. The burnout is real. I work outpatient now and it is still mentally exhausting. I have a minor in psych so I was a psych nurse.

,,Amazing_Lemon6783,,,,,I got a psychology degree but also I‚Äôm going to medical school. On its own the degree is useless. If you don‚Äôt want to do any type of grad school then do nursing 100%. If you want to go to medical school psychology is actually a pretty good choice.
,,Zealousideal-Cat-152,,,,,"I have a BA in psych. You can do basically any administrative/HR/office gig with it and make a decent living. It‚Äôs not a useless degree by any means. However, as others have pointed out, there‚Äôs not much to do with just the BA if you want psychology to be your career.  I‚Äôm getting my masters right now. It‚Äôs a long road, but it‚Äôs what I love so it was worth it for me. 

Medicine/nursing are very cool fields, but it‚Äôs pretty different from therapy or research psych. I considered the medical field but tbh, I‚Äôm squeamish. It wasn‚Äôt the helping profession for me. 

I would consider becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner if you‚Äôre interested in both fields. It requires advanced study, but there‚Äôs lots of work available and you can prescribe, give therapy, and have a private practice. It‚Äôs a pretty cool role imo."

,,generallydisagree,,,,,"If you are drawn to psychology, IMO, it's due to one of two primary reasons:

\#1: you suffer from mental illness (I would say well over 75% of people i've known that go into this field have plenty of their own issues)

\#2: you find the study of it fascinating

Sure, there are some that have seen the ravages of mental illness in others (family typically) and want to help such people.  FYI, I was a double major in college - one of them being psychology - which I think was fascinating and would help me in my career better understand other people's psyche.

Do you want to work with mentally ill people the rest of your life? Dentists and cops have very high suicide rates - because cops routinely interact with the dregs of society and Dentists recognize that pretty much everybody hates them (going to them).

If you were my daughter or spouse, I'd encourage nursing. Yeah, you'll still see and experience enough unpleasantness (depending on type of nurse) - but your helping other people is much more immediate and recognizable - and probably more rewarding on a day to day basis.  IMO"

With that said, nursing school (and working with healthcare professionals) really pushed me to my limits and unlocked potential I didn‚Äôt think even existed, so now when I walk into a project meeting both clinical and non-clinical stakeholders respect my input because that ‚ÄòBSN,RN‚Äô does carry weight and because leaderships knows that the 27yr old Deloitte sr associate is gonna spew bullshit and circle back with them to target the low hanging fruit - the 27yr old nurse implementation consultant would never do some shit like that because of how anal nursing culture is lol PM me if you still have questions OP."

,,Own-Load-7041,,,,,"If I had to do it over again...I would have not gotten a psych degree. However, at the time nursing was very competitive with few openings nearby. Now? I'd have gone anywhere to get it."
,,FlashySignificance21,,,,,Psychiatrists are typically some of the highest paid. Anything less and you‚Äôll probably be struggling. Nursing is in HUGE demand and often make more than doctors since they are paid overtime. They are both hard mentally. Nursing is hard physically too. But from a money perspective you are likely more secure with nursing.
,,No-Veterinarian-1446,,,,,Take psychology as a minor.  Be a psych nurse!
,,vacant_panda,,,,,I have a Masters degree in psychology. DO NOT. There is very little you can do with psychology. I work for an insurance company right now. Pay is great but the work is soul sucking.

,,KevSmileTime,,,,,At my school it was a communications major.

,,ReplacementAny4195,,,,,"No doubt about it, there are more options and more money in the nursing field. Just about anything in the healthcare 8ndustry is guaranteed to offer more. I wish my B.A. had launched me on a path to research in cell biology instead of psychology. 

As a bonus, consider that a psychiatric nurse, unlike LMFT, can accept MEDICARE patients, under federal regulations. Although in California, due to generous state policies, an LMFT is eligible for reimbursement under MEDICAID/MEDICARE .

And I am so envious of Travel Nurses!

Edit:  LMFTs ARE legally reimbursable under Medicare.  Thanks for the update, Zealous-ideal Cat!"

,,Independent-Spray707,,,,,"I stuck with the BA but got lucky and got a temp job at a really big company shortly after graduating doing HR stuff. Was also lucky to turn it into a full time role and work my way up.  Took a long time but I make a little over six figures exactly 10 years in this month.  

She made more money after graduating.  Was helped by working midnights for a while and getting as many certs as she could. Pre Covid she was making like $65-&
$70k with 6-7 years experience and not really taking the overtime offered.  Covid was crazy and she jumped over 6 figures for a few years.  This year it‚Äôs around $80k working 2-3 days/week. 

The biggest difference is that she can work anywhere and do stuff like float nurse positions that have higher wages.  If we needed the money she could consistently make 6 figures working overtime, and isn‚Äôt really at risk of losing her job in a bad economy."
,,Imaginary_Attempt_82,,,,,I‚Äôm a nurse in home health. But I‚Äôm like a nerd nurse- I do the (medical) coding and review and make sure documentation is correct.

,,thatpcunurse,,,,,"True, although it depends on the Magnet status of the hospital. I'm not saying that a BSN isn't useful at all, I was trying to point out that that was a great way to start WITH AN ASN. It just depends on what you are aiming for. I started with an ASN, got a great job, and then did online classes for my BSN. It doesn't pay much more, but if you choose to pursue a higher degree, say a masters, you'd be in a much faster route."

,,StationIllustrious94,,,,,So pharmacy would be an even better choice?
,,thatpcunurse,,,,,"Edit: didn't mean to capitalize WITH AN ASN. Apparently, I can't type."
,,Feeling-Visit1472,,,,,So you have no experience or extended exposure or even particular interest in either one? You should be basing this decision on more than what random strangers on the Internet think.
,,Purple7740,,,,,Idk i did my rotation at the state hospital where patients are either civily ordered or criminally ordered into their care.
,,Lifeinthesc,,,,,Correct here in the Deep South approximately 40-60% of the counties don‚Äôt have mental health providers of any kind. However there is a dramatic need for it. There is a reason that a disproportionate amount of ODs and suicides are in the rural areas.
,,lemunche1,,,,,"Good. I don‚Äôt know if I would do it for life since you make half what the nurse makes, but perform 90% of the actual labour. However, using it as a stepping stone to nursing and learning your field from the ground up is very rewarding. Being a tech before a nurse allows you to step in and help your techs get through patient turnover knowing what they are going through"
,,Imaginary_Attempt_82,,,,,"I got my associates degree in nursing, then went on and got my bachelor‚Äôs in nursing as well. I had thought about psych nursing in the past but I don‚Äôt think I would enjoy it as much as what I do now. But there‚Äôs definitely a need for good psych nurses."

,,Puzzleheaded_Hatter,,,,,"What's both to you?
Between pharmacy/ pharmaceuticals/healthcare I see 100s of individual jobs"
,,StationIllustrious94,,,,,Yea. They‚Äôre all the same
,,Puzzleheaded_Hatter,,,,,The only thing they have in common is that you're not qualified for any of the positions
,,StationIllustrious94,,,,,Why would I not be qualified? I can easily get that degree
,,Puzzleheaded_Hatter,,,,,"... sounds like you don't have a degree

The sectors I mentioned employ hundreds of degrees and certs.

So you're not qualified because you don't have any of the hundreds of applicable credentials and you can't even see the difference between a network admin, vs a software developer or a chemical engineer

You're not qualified because you're a credential-less child who thinks being a MD is the same as a Pharm D

it's the same reason your not qualified for any career"

,,johhuang,,,,,"I‚Äôm a product marketing manager in tech, and I wrestled with this same question a few years ago before I had a kid. For my entire life, I had it in my head that I needed to climb the corporate ladder, be an executive, and be highly recognized in my field to feel like I finally made it. 

What I came to slowly realize is the cost required to achieve that goal isn‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with executives, and they are constantly spending their time and energy on work at the expense of their health and family. Money and titles don‚Äôt mean anything when you‚Äôre dead. 

I think I finally found the sweet spot. Im a highly paid IC that gets to spend most of my time actually solving problems and getting my hands dirty building campaigns. I don‚Äôt have to deal with the BS that comes with rising up the ranks: planning, managing poor employees, hiring people, constantly building exec decks, etc. 

I can afford a large house in one of the most expensive markets in the US. My hours are 9-5 where I work from home and spend a lot of time hanging out with my kid. 

The hardest thing has been separating my identity from work because it has been so ingrained in me. Im still trying to find hobbies and community that make that easier. However, my number 1 thing that I want to be identified as is being a great father and dialing back my career ambitions means I have more time and energy to do that. Sacrificing and taking risks in my 20‚Äôs has given me the experience and salary level to now cruise so I‚Äôm hoping to ride this out as long as I can before I get screwed over by the ageism that exists for older workers in tech."

They wouldn't take after hours projects, they wouldn't bother with extra certs. They were just employees.

The issue is with people who lied to themselves. They only wanted to show up the minimum, they never did anything to learn more or advance their career and then they would complain at their annual review when they didn't get a promotion and the biggest raise.

,,Tarnarmour,,,,,"I'd say if you feel stressed then you may just be tricking yourself into accepting the image of success that is most commonly promoted by society, e.g. being rich and high achieving at work. That's *a* way to be successful but there's absolutely no rule saying that it's the only way. It sounds to me like you're totally successful because you've gotten into a place where your needs are satisfied, and you've got people you love to hang out with!

That's why they call it 'average'.

I strive to just not hate my job. I consider that as a massive win. I dont love it, but I don't hate it. That's fine. It is not my lifes purposes to become rich, famous, or a CEO. For some people it is, and that's fine. You are here to do you."
,,Year-Status,,,,,"Don't let others' standards dictate what your aspirations are.  

People always ask what do you do, and this is supposed to mean what do you do for work.  My answer is always activities I enjoy.

Bottom line, as long as you know why you do the things you do and what you're working towards, there's nothing wrong with feeling content with what you've worked for.  If you're happy, great.  If not, you'll do more. On your terms. Sit back and enjoy being in control of your own life."

,,vLegitimateBread,,,,,Yes it's very important that we're being completely honest with ourselves and with others too about our goals. Because if not we'd be setting up false expectations and be disappointed when cannot meet that false expectations.
,,vLegitimateBread,,,,,"Thank you! I am completely fine with the way my life is and the work I'm doing. But I'm not passionate about it. That sometimes makes me question if I'm missing something. But like you said, there's no way of saying there's only a certain way to be successful. So as long as we are happy and define our own success, who cares. Thanks for your response."
,,vLegitimateBread,,,,,Yeah it all comes down to our perspective of success. Great to hear your insight. I love reddit for this. People just sharing their unfiltered thoughts which I probably would never have known about from the real world as people tend to be dishonest with their image in real life from what I know.

Ask if they will allocate funds obtained by union dues to endorse and support political candidates. they‚Äôre going to tell you yes because it‚Äôs in the union memberships best interest to vote in people that have the unions interest at heart. The flipside to this is they‚Äôre going to vote for one particular party, whether you subscribe to that party or not it doesn‚Äôt matter, the unions job is to represent you, not give your money to who they think is a better political candidate. there‚Äôs also no guarantee that that candidate is going to win, so you stand a 50-50 chance of having your union dues wasted.

,,Johnclark77,,,,,"I was a teamster for 16 years, and a union rep for 11 during that time.

What I always told my members when we were up for a contract vote, was this:

There are two main points in the contract. The first is: how does it affect you right now, and how will it affect you at the end (4 or 5 years later)? This is a personal decision and it will be decided by pay, benefits, and other individual items.

The second is: how will this strengthen or weaken the union and its members as a whole? Will new hires going forward be less inclined to stay, accept work and OT distribution? Will this start to undercut different levels of seniority? Make people work more years, get less retirement value, lower PTO hours, access to other benefits, or anything else of that nature?

After you think about the pros and cons of those two ideas, is it a good contract? Go vote your conscience.Ive never pushed any member to vote yeas or no, just give them as much information as I can.

These are the two things you should be making your decision on.

When a workgroup first gets a contract, there can be good and bad changes. Things like rates of pay and vacation allotments can be decided based on groups of longevity. 1-5 years, 6-13, 13-20, 20+. Some folks may get stuck on the wrong side of a group and have pay or PTO negatively affected. Employers like to push this to stir bias against the idea of a union, blowing it way out of proportion. I've even read where they throw promotions (tite changes) and raises or other 'special' benifits at people in that middle area to try and fan this even more.

This is usually a very, very small portion of people affected and after a year will be back at the same or higher levels. The majority will stay the same or gain something. Also, the membership can ask to have those that may be negatively affected to be frozen until their seniority catches up to their pay/benefits."
,,JSutt771,,,,,"Nope.  I've been soured to unions.  I always hear about all the great things unions do for you, as a worker, but every union I've ever been a part of is just out for union dues and wants to sway you to vote a certain way.

I was being trained by the union rep at one job and they told me flat out, ""it doesn't matter what the employee did, it doesn't matter what the fallout was, it doesn't matter how in the wrong they were.  It's my job to make it the company's fault"".  The result was that we had some of the most useless, most worthless people on the face of the planet working there who couldn't get fired short of committing murder.  

I was a contractor at another (so not union) but worked in the same shop as the union did.  I was walking by a scissor lift one day and accidentally knocked over a bucket and broom off the lift.  I started to pick it up and I got yelled at.  ""Nope!  You can't touch that!  You have to stand there and make sure nobody trips over it until we get a general laborer to pick it up.""  Union rules.  Can't give one man's work to another.  And God forbid the work be given to someone outside the union.

Just a few examples.  Fuck that noise.  I do just fine without the drama and political pressure.  I vote no."

Companies must have a worker representative on the board. They‚Äôre also an export power house. Same is true for many other industrialized nations. 


Whatever excesses unions may have are vastly outweighed by their good. Remember kids, if not for unions you wouldn‚Äôt have a 5 day work week. In fact, I would argue (and I‚Äôm sure other academics have as well) that the reason we don‚Äôt see a reduction in hours worked in America even though our GDP is rising is precisely because workers have no bargaining power."
,,Sufficient_Day2166,,,,,Depends on how good the company treats its employees. Would also research the union to see what all they have and can do for the people. I work at a place that has a horrible union. All it does is help the company and could care less about the people.

UNION.  If I knew more that day in college when a union rep stepped to talk to our engineering class.  We were probably unanimous in our derision.  If only he'd have told us how much our neighbours 3 states down were making.  How much profit that the company was making.  CEO pay etc.  
Yep UNION."
,,Citizen-Kang,,,,,"The information you need is:  Yes, you want a union.  Unless it's a police union, you want the union."
,,abbylynn2u,,,,,"If I knew nothing... walking in I'd vote yes, simply for my coworkers as long as dues were reasonable.

Are you in a right to work state or an at will to to work state. It makes a difference. Knowing the difference is important with regard to unions and termination of employment. 

Is it an open shop or a closed shop.?

Does this particular union have a good track record locally, in the state and on the national level.?

Are there other like businesses in this particular union? If not, why not go with one aligned in your business/industry.

I don't believe every business or industry or profession needs a union. It really depends on what's happening.

I've had the please of non union low level work, open shop low level union work, closed shop low level union work that worked closely with closed shop mid level to high level work, and non union mid to high level work.

In the late 80s worked at opening a brand new hotel where the the owner and investors made it clear they work not pro union. They offered premium insurance that covered every employee free with low out of pocket costs. Low cost family coverage. Great benefits. Great working environment... the GM and leadership team would come and help during 95% or higher occupancy rate. If that meant taking bags to rooms, picking up room service Trays or taking it the trash they did it. Did I mention or starting pay was 3.00 to 4.00 higher for every postion across the board. So we were the highest paid hotel employees in the state. I worked off and on for 15 years with them.

In the 90s I tempted (now known as contract employee) in a Healthcare business office that eventually voted to join a union. I didn't see what benefits this particular union had to offer. The worst 100.00 a month these folks voted for. It was the wrong union to join. 
But mostly the staff didn't work hard enough to push out bad managers and supervisors. One off hand conversation with the CFO to follow up on a project I'd been assigned and why it wasn't done pushed both said managers out in a month. Both were blocking me from getting a response to questions I had. I explained the manager said all questions needed to be approved by my supervisor before sending them directly to the CFO, even though that had asked for me specifically to work on the project. I forwarded my questions to him after he sent me a direct email and to not discuss it. I got my answers and he got his project.

In the 90s worked in a open shop and was secretary for a hot minute like 4 months then left the company. Nothing like folks that don't pay dues wanting help with being written up and terminated but didn't pay dues. That's a flat no. The first year I didn't join. Then I was asked to be on the negotiating team since I had experience working at 4 other similar businesses. So I joined. The union really was about negotiating for benefits. We did good. We honestly had very few HR issues compared to most like size places. Over all a great place to work.

Most recently a closed shop with lots of issues with the business as an office worker. Overall I thought the union was pretty ineffective at the state level amd meeting our needs. My issues languished for 3 years without resolution until March 2020. 

For the most part most companies don't need a union. But those that do do. Amazon warehouses yes... I have stories from when they were just a book seller.. lol  Retail chains yes like Starbucks and the like... yes. Trades... yes
Don't forget there are professionals like the BOEING engineers that are union. 

I haven't decided yet on gig economy delivery drivers. Part of me says yes because it could give them access to benefits like group insurance rates that are better than the open market. Minimum pay scale. Access to live customer service. A way to deal with the random deactivation. 

Lots to think about. Having mostly worked in offices I haven't needed a union."
,,lphomiej,,,,,Yes.
,,Gullible-Dog2545,,,,,Based on my personal experiences absolutely not. Give up 50 dollars of your pay every month and get nothing in return. The whole thing is a scam if you want my honest opinion.

,,,,,,,"Only thing I'd need to know is the time and date of when we're voting and where do I check ""YES""."
,,doublen00b,,,,," Im not in a union but my understanding is that they are probably a better deal for 80-90% of workers. The few in your company that may be near the top of their companies heirarchy are the ones who would see little to no benefit, for everyone else its usually better.

The reason being the union does a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of negotiation, something most employees have little experience with."
,,Saillux,,,,,"I'm in a big union. Every time I get mailers about how I should quit my union, I can't help noticing they're funded by groups of people that have a profit motive to pay me lower wages."
,,TycheSong,,,,,"I would want to see concrete numbers and statistics.

,,Heavy_Ape,,,,,"I'd want to understand dues, bargaining, support, etc.

I'm a manager. Company line is 'unions are bad, mmkay'.

The training provided for anti union is to highlight the lack of flexibility to assist union members due to the contract.

I would prefer it as a manager.

No more grey area bullshit. Rules are clearly defined. Pay is clearly defined. It would help make my life easier.

Can't say that at work tho."
,,fptackle,,,,,"I'd vote yes.

But, I'd like to bring up that the union, any union, is only as strong as its membership.   The members have to be willing to band together and work to achieve the changes they want."
,,RichM5,,,,,"It depends on the strength of the union and if my working life would be that much better under a union than not. Lots of unions just want to collect the dues and do nothing for their members, Or at least enough to make it worth paying. Also would bring in the union help outside of the company you currently work for. For example a trade union is good because you keep your union status from one job to another. So you pension keeps getting funded. If it‚Äôs a manufacturing job  and that union does not have other companies that you would gonto work for incase you get laid off or want to quit than it‚Äôs not worth it IMO."

,,elbarbalarga,,,,,"<Ask if they will allocate funds obtained by union dues to endorse and support political candidates. they‚Äôre going to tell you yes>

Giving union dues to political candidates is illegal. Only voluntarily donated funds earmarked for political activity can be used for that. 

Using a portion of union dues to influence lawmaking is okay. Like paying the rep to go to the Capitol and speak to a bill related to their field, or using his time to get a law or regulation passed, but that portion of dues can be objected to if the member insists.

I mean, that is the literal job of a union rep.  If they don't attempt that in good faith, then they would be a shitty rep.  This doesn't mean that if a member messes up or does something terrible that the union rep is going to succeed in helping that individual keep their job.  It's no different than when a defense lawyer defends someone who is suspected of committing a crime.

Now, if that rep was easily able to keep a lot of shitty union members from being fired for things that most people would get fired for, again, that is the fault of the company agreeing to a shitty CBA."

,,milotrain,,,,,"The union sets minimum hourly rates for every position in the union, and sets minimum daily or weekly calls.  If I get called in to work then I get paid 9 hrs no matter what happens.

The union requires that in addition to my hourly rate the company pays into a healthcare and pension program that is very good and covers my entire family for very little out of pocket.

The union requires that I be paid every week no matter what the client is paying, this means that the company I work for could be struggling and at worst I will lose a week of pay.

The union establishes training (less so now and we are working more on that) for new technology and new workflows.

If a company fails to pay me, or fails to pay my proper hours, or is otherwise shady the union will get involved."
,,HVAC_T3CH,,,,,"In my field I was earning $20 an hour after 7years. From that $20 taxes, 401k, health insurance we‚Äôre all deducted.

I came to a union shop where I was offered $22 and hour, my first paycheck was double my previous employers. At $22 the only deduction was taxes, everything else is packaged, now as a 5th year apprentice im at $37 and that‚Äôs not over scale. Our union just negotiated a >$12 raise over 4 years.

The insurance is fully funded by the union, meaning we have a few million in the bank and for every hour worked $8.50 goes into that account, that‚Äôs what pays for our medical expenses, we still have a copay but the union just set up an agreement with a local healthcare provider that any service provided by them, (clinic/urgent care, not a hospital) would be free of charge for our members and family.

Pension, after 7 years I have $30k in my 401k from my previous employer, after 5 years with the union im at over $55k.

Representation. If there were ever a Grievance where I had to attend a meeting with my supervisors and the meeting would end in discipline I am allowed to have a union rep sit in and mediate to ensure I am not taken advantage of.

Education, my union has a multimillion dollar training facility where new members undergo a 5 year apprenticeship, consisting of on the job training, payed day school instruction and unpaid night schooling. The night school classes cover every major topic in our field and many specialized topics as well, any member can take a night school class free of charge."

Having a union means all workers share power by combining it into a union representative. At minimum this means you get some basic protections depending on your work area regarding safety and hours. As well as preventing the employer from making unilateral decisions. 

Unions will also help regulate and negotiate salaries and raises over the years, so even though they do come with some up-front costs you will make it back in the long run, meaning the main reason to say no is knowing you'll leave soon and screwing everyone else left behind"

We just had a union strike and it had one of the most powerful positions it could be in, and congress voted to prevent it.  and not by giving the workers what they wanted, but by fucking them.  so if unions go away entirely as you have stated, then the companies which already have MASSIVE power, will have almost unrestricted power, since the government has shown they will not provide the protections workers need.  so can i point to 1 specific thing in the last 20 years that they have done no, but on average union workers have higher pay, better benefits and more job security.  are those flashy and bright, no are they good, yes."

,,Gullible-Dog2545,,,,,Most private companies I believe are owned by good people who genuinely care about the best interest of their employees. There may be some where that is not the case but I believe those to be the exception not the rule. With unionization I also believe heightened job security sometimes does more harm than good. In most cases it just prevents bad workers from getting fired at the expense of all the good workers who happen to be non union members.

So, you‚Äôre no older than 36, but really, you‚Äôre more like 26-28.

Fine.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre 36.

You have $24k in guaranteed income.  Most state schools offer veterans a tuition waver.  With the GI bill paying an E-5 housing allowance, you can basically go back to school full time for ANYTHING and not even work.

,,ChewbaccaEatsGrogu,,,,,"It's never too late! 

If you have a fairly easy job that puts you in good financial shape you have a lot of options.

First, make sure you are saving and investing. Having a nest egg to fall back on makes any future transition less stressful.

Beyond that, if you want to make a meaningful contribution, there are many ways to do that outside of work by volunteering and donating to organizations you believe in. Do your research though. There are, unfortunately, a lot of wolves in sheep's clothing in the nonprofit world. 

For your potential new career, are there any subjects you particularly gravitate to that you would feel good researching or taking some classes in? There has never been a better time in the history of the world for self education.  Also consider ways your current skillset might transfer to a similar job that is in an organization that checks the ethical boxes you're looking for. I am sure many big organizations that do good could benefit from your expertise.  It may not be hands on work helping people, but many nonprofits that seek to do good fail because they lack competent administration. Sometimes knowing your labor is helping facilitate good deeds makes a giant difference vs just helping a conglomerate make more money."
,,flamingoesarepink,,,,,"Our fulfillment as people doesn't have to come from paid work.

Look into volunteering for organizations and outreach groups that interest you.  There are so many organizations that need boots on the ground to help fulfill their mission statements.  

When I had a financially stable, but sucky job, I helped run a small food pantry.  It was only a few hours a week, but I got so much out of it. 

In another period of my life I volunteered at the animal shelter - scooping poop, washing bedding, walking dogs.  That's no longer an option for me, though, because I got too emotionally attached to the animals and wound up adopting several. 

Or, do you like a sport or hobby?  There are many pick-up leagues and other organizations.   I know this one isn't necessarily helping ppl, but it's another way to connect with folks.

Whether or not you decide to go back to school for the next 4 years you will still turn 30 in 4 years.

I know this is super long winded but foreals write down a list of the top 5 things that are at the top of your needs for life, for instance some people have philanthropy in their top 5 and some dont have it in their top 50, you have to decide what is the most important things you want to accomplish in this life. As i said before the clock keeps ticking regardless of what you do, so you might as well do what you feel pulled to do, is this sound financial advice? No, but if you aren't in a position where you HAVE to do this, then why sit around WISHING and WANTING instead of going and getting what you want, finding purpose isnt easy and majority of us either struggle with it or dont even believe in it, but if you have a dream and you're able to, why not chase it? Hope this helps in even a small way and i sincerely hope you find your way and see your dreams come to fruition."
,,TheOneBifi,,,,,"Since you don't have a degree or experience it'll be hard to find another job, especially one that's fulfilling and decently paid. However, you're making good money and it feels from how you speak that it's not too time consuming. 

You should start looking at volunteering, no job will ever be rewarding in the sense that you want (helping people) as volunteering for something you personally connect with."
,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"It's important to prioritize your long-term happiness and fulfillment.

,,tscottn,,,,,"I was where you are now at exactly your age.  I have a BS in Comp Science.  Worked my way up from low lvl tech to manager/director in about 6 years.  By the time i was 26/27 I felt so unfulfilled and miserable. I hated making corporations rich.   No amount of money could change that.  My life was a boring slog of meetings and corporate BS/ CYA Emails/ managing techs etc. on the daily.  I absolutley hated it even though I thought I would love it because I love computers and tech stuff in general.  

Started thinking about how to change my life.  One day I heard a friend of mine at work talking about going on a introductory helicopter flight with a local flight school to learn to fly helicopters.  I thought that was interesting and one of my hobbies was RC helicopters and airplanes.  I got the number to the school from him and setup a appt.  After the flight I was hooked.

20 years later, and I have been all over the world flying helicopters.  The most fulfilling field has been flying medivac and having a direct impact on saving lives and being able to do something im proud of and love to do at the same time.  Super rewarding.  These days I fly for a large news corporation.  Its fun and still very rewarding.  I wouldn't change this career for the world.  I'm proud of what I do and get paid decently to do it.  AMA if you want."
,,Inkkor,,,,,"You can always look at behavioral health advocate outreach programs to dip your toes into the psychology field. You would need certifications and bachelors degree if you want to become a behavioral health therapist. If you want to be a psychologist, you would likely have to get a masters degree. Maybe even a phd. If you want to be a psychiatrist, you would need to have a D.O or M.D level of education as psychiatrists prescribe medication. If you were to look into medicine field, experience and education depends on where you want to go. 

I would definitely look into USA Jobs to see if there are any entry level fields in either one of these fields. Since you are a veteran, if you explore USA Jobs and find ones that have veteran preference and not ‚Äúdirect hire‚Äù, you will automatically rank higher in the referral stages. 

Ultimately, you were in USMC, which grants you an advantage of acquiring a college education at little to no cost using the GI Bill. I would definitely look into exploring this option and take full advantage of American Military University. I went to that college some time ago but on civilian side and was impressed at the pace of remote education."

,,havocbyday,,,,,"Changing careers multiple times is actually quite common these days, and from personal experience, quite fulfilling. At 26, you are still very early into your career, so don‚Äôt fret! The key though is taking the right steps to set you up for success if you decide to make moves. 

In your case, getting a degree is going to be critical unless you decide to go the tradesman route (where technical training is paramount). The nice thing though is you have a job, steady income and you seem to have spare time available. Consider pursuing a degree on nights/weekends while working. Deloitte likely has some form of tuition reimbursement and if not, consider this an investment in yourself. You will also de-risk the entire endeavor by staying employed while doing it. 

I won‚Äôt lie to you, it will be a sacrifice and it‚Äôll at times be hard balancing both a job and school, but you can do it. I just completed my MBA in my 40‚Äôs, while holding a senior level role and having a family. It was brutal at times, but totally worth it - especially because like yourself, I was in a rut. Stimulating your mind, pursuing new interests and (very) importantly, networking with new individuals will go a long way to changing your prospects. Now you just need to go do it. Good luck!"
,,CurrentGoal4559,,,,,"You will never feel fulfilled in corporate world.  My freind is working in tech, making 350k year total comp.  That's his exact words - ""I am feeling like I'm wasting my life"""
,,Pinche_Gringo_621311,,,,,You are not your job. Find something besides work to feel fulfilled.
,,killerdude23233,,,,,"A job is a job. Its nice to find one that is also satisfying and fulfilling like you described, but also try to find fulfillment outside of work. Most folks only work 40 hours per week. That leaves a lot of time to dedicate to literally anything that will help fulfill that need, whether it's learning new skills, a different trade, a hobby, etc. 

I personally find great satisfaction in creating things and tinkering, usually modding consoles, making videos, or just creating new pieces of art across different mediums. I got back into cross-stitching video game pixel art more recently, and it is far more fulfilling than anything I could dream of doing as a career.

If the problem is you're working too much (ie more than 40 hours) then that leaves little time for yourself. At that point I would consider maybe changing up jobs. We work to live, not live to work."
,,expressuserjohn,,,,," It's great that you're seeking advice and exploring your career options. First of all, it's important to remember that it's never too late to make a career change or pursue your passions. Many people change careers multiple times throughout their lives, and age shouldn't be a limiting factor.  
  
Considering your desire to work in a field where you can have a direct impact on people's lives, like medicine or psychology, it's worth exploring those options further. While switching careers can be challenging, it's definitely achievable with careful planning and preparation.  
  
Here are a few steps you can consider taking:  
  
Self-assessment: Reflect on your interests, values, and skills. Determine what aspects of medicine or psychology appeal to you the most. This will help you identify potential paths within these fields that align with your interests and strengths.  
  
Research: Dive deep into the professions you're interested in. Learn about the educational requirements, job prospects, and potential career paths within medicine and psychology. Look into different specializations and roles to get a better sense of what might be a good fit for you.  
  
Education and Training: While you mentioned not having a college degree, it's important to note that there are various educational pathways to consider. Look into degree programs, certifications, and vocational training that can help you transition into your desired field. Consider the time commitment, financial implications, and potential support available (e.g., scholarships, grants, or part-time study options).  
  
Networking and Mentorship: Connect with professionals already working in the fields you're interested in. Attend industry events, join relevant online communities, and reach out to people for informational interviews. Their insights and experiences can provide valuable guidance as you navigate your career change.  
  
Gain Experience: Look for ways to gain hands-on experience in your desired field. This could involve volunteering, shadowing professionals, or working part-time in a related role. Practical experience will not only help you solidify your decision but also enhance your resume when you're ready to make the transition.  
  
Financial Considerations: Assess your financial situation and plan accordingly. Changing careers might involve a temporary decrease in income or additional educational expenses. Make sure you have a realistic financial plan in place to support yourself during the transition.  
  
Take It Step by Step: Changing careers can be a gradual process. You might start by exploring opportunities to gain exposure to your desired field while still maintaining your current job. This allows you to test the waters and ensure that the new career path is indeed the right fit for you.  
  
Remember, pursuing a fulfilling career is a lifelong journey. It's okay to feel uncertain or overwhelmed at times, but taking small steps and staying persistent will help you move forward. Trust yourself and believe in your ability to make a positive change. Best of luck on your career exploration!

,,avid_life,,,,,"As others have suggested, why not consider finding your fulfillment outside of work through volunteering or a hobby?

Plus, depending on your current cost of living, you may be in a very good position to budget, invest well, and retire early. It sounds like you could be a good candidate for the FIRE method. Reach financial independence after a few more years of your boring job and then live out the hopefully long remainder of your life in a way that is fulfilling to you."
,,818a,,,,,"I changed careers at 50, so you definitely can change several more times if you want to. Going to school really helped me figure it out. Keep steering and you'll find a path."
,,newwriter365,,,,,"Why do you need to work for so long? Head over to r/FIRE and get on a path to early retirement.

I‚Äôve worked at six-figure jobs and have downgraded my job to one with little to no stress (but a lot less money) because I didn‚Äôt have a commitment to retire early.

If I had it to do over again I‚Äôd definitely stash cash and head into retirement in my late 40‚Äôs or early fifties."
,,FlakyAd7090,,,,,Agreed. No college degree and 6 figures?? I have my degree and don‚Äôt even make 40k. Also had my degree before joining the Air Force. I would kill to be this person.
,,NorCalMikey,,,,,I would say the same thing.
,,hauntedbathhouse,,,,,"Was going to say the same thing! When I realized that my sense of fulfillment didn‚Äôt have to come from my career, my whole life changed for the better."
,,lazyygothh,,,,,"Damn is 35 that old? I went hard in my 20s after college playing in a band and zipped right into my late 20s without a real career. 

I‚Äôve been making good money the past few years but not really working a real career type job. I‚Äôm 32 and looking to transition into another role."
,,UntoldThrowAway,,,,,I think one of the issues is that I did IT in the Marines as well. So I have 7+ years of experiencing in my job field and feel as thought it would be too hard to just dump all of that and try to relearn something completely different. You raise a lot of valid points and I'll definitely have to do some soul-searching.
,,Inkkor,,,,,I didn‚Äôt have a breakout into a real career until I was 28. 33 now with close to six figures and stable career. IT industry is fun if you like puzzles and problem solving.
,,osunightfall,,,,,"I'm just saying, the longer you wait the harder it gets to have time to make good progress in your new career. There is not really a hard limit depending on the field you want to go into. I feel like 35 is where you really at least want to have a goal in mind and be on the path to it. Things often get a little harder then, just because older people tend to have more responsibilities and other things getting in their way. In the end this is all just my personal feeling and they're guidelines anyway. You will always have to assess your own situation, how hard it will be to get into the new career, what advancement is like in that career, etc. I have seen people successfully change career at 50, and I have seen people fail to do so at 30. YMMV."
,,No_Fisherman8303,,,,,Sooner is better because of the return on investment. The more time you have to reap the rewards of time and money spent on education the bigger the return.
,,Ryrysg99,,,,,"I mean is there anyway your IT skills can translate to something relative to what you want to do? Im not too well versed in the IT sphere, but in the construction realm I‚Äôve personally went from Operating heavy machinery to surveying and its 2 completely different jobs, which require completely different skillsets, but alot of my knowledge from being a operator translated to a deeper understanding of Surveying, again the IT world might be completely different but if you can find something that checks both boxes i think its worth pursuing, course if its the IT part of it thats really wearing you down id say try something new before you‚Äôre 40 having these thoughts again you know?"
,,lazyygothh,,,,,I was wanting to get into programming but it is a bit competitive atm if you don‚Äôt have the right background. A friend of mine does autocad drafting. He says it is in demand in my area and I can get 6 figures in two years if I play it right
,,lazyygothh,,,,,"I feel you. You are right that there are more obstacles. I have a family and a house, so definitely more things on my to do list."
,,SimpleGreenCiCiLick,,,,,That‚Äôs a lateral move bro try going from construction to venture capital and see what carry‚Äôs over haha
,,No_Fisherman8303,,,,,6 figures in AutoCAD? You might want to check the job boards before you take the plunge. I love working with CAD but didn't hit 6 figures until I got into PCB design which is very different. A lot of CAD work moved off shore over the last 10 years. So you are competing with $5 an hour workers.
,,lazyygothh,,,,,"He says a mutual friend got a job making 90k in two years. Oil and gas. He also just got a job plus 6 figures. No real reason to think he is lying.

,,Barflyerdammit,,,,,"Hard to say exactly what's going on here, but I would ask two questions: 
1) get the name and contact info of a manager in the new location, apply first, then reach out to your new manager.

2) ask for a letter of recommendation from your current manager. If they're happy to do it, ask if they'll send it to the new location.

Good luck."
,,JosePrettyChili,,,,,"My dear young friend. Let me address your last bit first. Your company doesn't care about you. They never will. No company does. They only will ever do as much for you as is good for them. So do what you need to do at work, but if you're feeling like you're pouring your life and soul into work, take a step back and make sure your work life balance is in balance. 

In terms of your transfer, do what you need to do. Submit your applications, etc. Don't count on your manager to do it for you. And treat this as a learning opportunity. You do you, don't wait on anyone do for you. Blessings on you."
,,ladeedah1988,,,,,"Yes, in my company.  You just can't decide to move to a new location.  They may be looking to balance different strengths among their staff.  Also, another manager wants to make certain you will fit in their team."
,,takes12KNOW,,,,,"Apply to your own company and 40x more, don't settle for the job you have. Instead use your experience to get a better gig with better pay"
,,LowVoltLife,,,,,It depends on the company. The company I worked for at my last job was pretty good about transferring between call center locations.
,,from_whereiggypopped,,,,,"I would put in an application for the positions you want in the city that you're looking to move to.  I'd be upfront that I work for the company in another locale but am getting mixed signals whether or not you can transfer.  I'd even offer to quit the present location and move to the new city and begin again as a new hire although that isn't really what you'd like to do,  then let them navigate the process of transferring you."
,,NeedSomeHelpHere4785,,,,,Not common at all for a company to let you move around like that without applying for the other position. I assume the pay might be lower at the other center as well but I don't know. Apply for the job and any other job. The company isn't doing you wrong really but they also don't care about you one way or the other.
,,tracyinge,,,,,"Well, there's no law that your company has to be fair.  Unless you're covered by a union contract or something and it addresses transfers.

Its' probably a money thing.  Wages are probably lower at the Florida branch and they don't want to pay you what California is paying you, especially if they know they can find someone locally who will work for less.

It could even be a political thing.  Lots of conservatives in Florida just can't stand California and those crazy liberals and woke people ""out there"". They lump all Californians into one big batch of crazy, even though California actually has more conservatives than Florida does.   The manager is probably afraid to hire a 20 year old until he meets you and verifies that you're not a drag queen or something, lol."
,,sirgatez,,,,,"Unfortunately, it depends on the company. Everyone has different policies. And there is no ""law"" that requires them to behave a specific way (as far as you moving from one area of the country where an office is located to another area where an office is located.

Unfortunately, for you, if you were a remote worker, you could change states at will.

But you're employer is under no obligation to transfer you from one physical location to another."
,,Maximum-Staff5310,,,,,"Here's the deal. You are asking several busy people to do a bunch of extra work to help you solve a personal problem. Your boss, for example, will not only have to do a bunch of stuff to get you a ""transfer"", but now he has to do a bunch of stuff to replace you. Same as somebody in HR. Not to mention the new boss. 

That's just not likely to happen. Everybody has family problems. Most everybody is expected to deal with those problems on their own time. You will have to find employment in the new location yourself. If not with this company, then some other company."
,,Sagitario05,,,,,Should i email the new manager? Including the recomendation letter
,,Sagitario05,,,,,What should i say on that email?

,,Happiness_Buzzard,,,,,"Exactly. 

It could be that company isn‚Äôt accepting transfers; could be that the manager doesn‚Äôt want to do the work.

,,Barflyerdammit,,,,,Definitely.
,,Salt_Tooth2894,,,,,"Yes.  Different companies have different ways they operate.  But in my company, if I want to move someone from Akron to Omaha or whatever, I do have to open a listing (or have them apply to an existing listing).  There's just all sorts of paperwork that has to be done by various departments and that's required to kick it all off.   Even if I needed someone in Omaha and my buddy in Akron called and said ""I've got the perfect gal for you!""  I'd still need them to fill out the proper forms so I could make the transfer happen.    


So I would apply -- and also contact the FLA hiring manager directly."
,,Barflyerdammit,,,,,"Not annoying at all, my friend. We were all young once and not everyone had a network of professional adults to give them advice. Most of what I learned at your age came from farmers, and it wasn't good advice. I'd say something like: 

Dear Mr Spacely (use his real name, not the name of the boss from the Jetsons.),

My name is Sagitario05 and I'm currently a [name of your job] at [name of company] in [name of city your office is in.]

I'll be relocating to [name of city you want to work in] on April 30, and would love to continue my career with [company.] I have filled out an online application for your office, and would love to speak to someone about the role.

I've attached a letter of recommendation from my previous manager, feel free to contact him directly if you'd like to learn more.

All the best,

And dude, 20 is way too young to worry much about that credit score. Also, it's harder to fuck that up than you think. Just never be more than 30 days late."
,,Maximum-Staff5310,,,,,Their job entails whatever their boss says it does. Not what you say it does. Nobody is obligated to lift a finger to help you except you. Help yourself. Start looking for a job in the new location. He told you to apply for that opening. Just do it.
,,Bluusoda,,,,,Nice letter. You‚Äôre a good dude.
,,Sagitario05,,,,,"He promised me the transfer and he is also a transfer from another center so it is definitely not uncommon where i work at. as a boss you want to help and guide your employees specially if that employee is an exceptional employee, they know how important this job is to me, so maybe not everyone is a cold hearted MF like you are,  i really hope youre not a boss"

,,Professional_Turn928,,,,,Experience trumps education but it doesn‚Äôt account for marketability. Yes you will have more interest because nowadays HRIS systems screen your resume and will not rank it as high if you don‚Äôt have that qualification.

,,JSutt771,,,,,"I'll second this.  I graduated WGU and I much prefer their methods over traditional brick and mortar schools.

You'll get certifications as part of the degree, and with having been in the industry for so long a lot of the classes will be easy for you.

The best part is they allow you to test out of classes.  If you are already confident in the material, or are just a quick study, you can just take the final and move on to the next class.  You also don't pay per class, like other schools.  You pay for 6 month periods of access, so the faster you get through the material the cheaper the degree is."

If they like it, they dive deeper into that, if they hate it, they will bounce away and go to something less like the original opportunity.

Once you have a couple of years' experience you can write your own ticket. That's the bright side."

,,,,,,,"May I suggest the first thing you should do is take 3 days off and finish this one book called ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck"" by Mark Manson. The concept he mentioned, such as the *backwards law*:

> ‚ÄúThe idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.‚Äù Pg10 

*hedonistic treadmill*

> ""The idea that we‚Äôre always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel different.‚Äù Pg35


> ‚ÄúAn obsession and overinvestment in emotion fail us for the simple reason that emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more. A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù -  a new house, a new relationship, another child, another ay raise. And despite all of our sweat and strain, we end up feeling eerily similar to how we started; inadequate.‚Äù Pg35

Cybersecurity is interesting (I'm in it), but yes, it can be draining, and sometimes it can be majorly depressing (I still have nightmares of sudden phone ringing and emergency incident response handling from my SOC years, and that's from only 3 years). I even resigned from my security operations center (SOC) analyst job as it had affected me mentally and physically ( the 12 hour rotational shifts had whacked out my hormones). But it's a big field, so there's maybe other niches within cybersecurity that can be less daunting.

Maybe you can try new things. Find out about digital nomad careers. In the meantime, just have one job that you can do to ensure sustenance while trying around new stuff. You can try the stream again, but rather than think it's for validation, make it a tutorial so those who discovered you learn something about the music you played.

Media and communications....try writing. Whether it's content writing for others, or write a blog. Write a blog on all kinds of careers you've tried, what you like about it, what you are uncomfortable with.

Those are some things I can suggest. I can't say I understand how you feel (as I'm not in your place), but I had been feeling lost (Have 3 loans needed to pay, will end apprenticeship and possibly become unemployed again early next year, just have an inkling on what I think I should do next, but at least now I have a plan compared to being fully lost before). I'm 29 too by the way. There's still so much uncertainty in my life going forward, but one step at a time, one problem at a time.

I hope you take care too."

,,OdinSaysToChill4932,,,,,"Sounds like some of it might be a change in perspective.   


if finding a job you enjoy is really important to you, I‚Äôm not saying you should give up on that. But‚Ä¶it might be good to find some acceptance for the fact that you may NEVER 100% enjoy whatever job you have 

Whether it‚Äôs teaching or music or cyber security, work is work, and every job has pros and cons. If you‚Äòre waiting for a magical feeling that says ‚Äúthis is my purpose,‚Äù it‚Äôs probably never going to come 

sometimes things feel boring, or unfulfilling, or imperfect. But that‚Äôs a part of life, we need to be able to function, even when those emotions come up.   


So I would challenge you to practice sitting with unpleasant emotions instead of numbing them to chase the next thing 

life doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect. YOU don‚Äòt have to be perfect. You have a family you actually like spending time with, do you understand how rare that can be?   


when you notice yourself wanting to make a change, practice being still. Take a few breaths, channel the feelings into exercise. Journal about whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to avoid 

(just my two cents, not trying to be harsh. Good luck to you)."
,,,,,,,"I feel you and I wonder if there‚Äôs a reason you like being with the family, but not out among others at a job . . . and that reason is how these surroundings make you feel about yourself. Maybe you could give it some thought and/or talk it over with your psychiatrist. 
What does the home/family make you feel? Cozy? Safe? Appreciated? Understood? Loved? Important? Valued?
Is it possible that the reason you‚Äôre feeling bad at work (and maybe in social situations) is that you don‚Äôt feel those things? Like maybe you feel unsafe (sometimes you can get this kind of anxiety and it‚Äôs really subtle and you don‚Äôt even realize what‚Äôs going on below the surface). Or maybe you don‚Äôt feel understood? Or maybe you can tell you‚Äôre not valued? Or maybe you‚Äôre a bit self-centered because of being loved/spoiled at home and you get aggravated when it‚Äôs not all about you and you‚Äôre not the star? (I mean this in the nicest possible way‚Äînot judging. Many of us have this problem!) You said something about prestige and it reminded me of myself. I always felt like I was supposed to be something special and important. It took a lot of years, tons of introspection, some good friends, lots of living, and some therapy to realize how much of this was just ego. I‚Äôm a special person, and so are you and so are we all. But there is no reason I should be any more famous or held in more esteem or more valued than anyone else. There are so many people in this world. I do not need them all staring at me and clapping. As soon as I realized it was okay to live a whole life without getting a gold star for being the bestest person, it was like a revelation. We are what we do, even if what we do only affects two or three people in a positive way. You sound young so if you can learn at your age to say no to ego and yes to just being a good person who has a positive impact in your small circle, you‚Äôll grow and go far. And if you just concentrate on doing things for a few, over time you might actually get accolades and deserve them! But try to treat those kinds of thoughts like what they are‚ÄîEgo calling your name. As far as work goes‚Äîif you don‚Äôt feel prestigious yourself, maybe working at some place with a bit of prestige will help. If you gain respect from being associated with your workplace, it can help you hold your head up a bit and walk tall, even if your position/contribution there is modest.

,,LedLenson,,,,,"Yes you are on to something‚Ä¶ I am probably privileged, spoiled, too loved during the childhood, do feel safe with my family but never at work‚Ä¶. Or it depends so much. I feel love to my family But I dont feel that to co-workers but I don‚Äôt feel threatened either. I do feel disliked though. I‚Äôm tall, workout a lot, care too much about how I look, but I don‚Äôt have an attitude at all I‚Äôm very humble and friendly but some people feel threatened by me I feel sometimes. My last job in sales I didn‚Äôt like for several reasons but the one I quit 2 months ago had a much more chill culture so I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe. Rather unappreciated, like I could do more, like what I was doing was complete shit for someone else to do. It was in the environmental friendly industry because I wanted to see if ‚Äúdoing something good for the community‚Äù could make me more motivated‚Ä¶. You are right about many of the things you write. I do feel stressed out over the fact that I wasted so much time in music that could have been spent on real education and work experience‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs easy to say now though in retrospective.. 

I don‚Äôt feel interested in things, have no energy and no inspiration to help others or to put in effort really‚Ä¶

How do you mean working at a prestigious place would help?"
,,,,,,,No problem. Just glad it helps
,,,,,,,"I feel like time doing music is never a waste. 

What I meant by a prestigious place. Many of us are raised with the idea that we should have an important career or some sort of status as adults. In my family, for instance, it felt like there was an expectation that we would ‚Äúbe somebody‚Äù meaning do something of note. Basically something our parents could brag about. This is common in certain cultures and I guess in certain ‚Äúsocial class‚Äù levels. As a result, I feel like our parents really only acknowledged our careers when we shone at them and achieved a level of fame or status. ‚ÄúDid you hear? Henry got promoted to head of office.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlex sold photos to X magazine and one will be on the cover next month.‚Äù While meanwhile, my sister who works every day as a nurse went under appreciated. Sure they were happy when she graduated nursing school and got a job. But she never did anything to ‚Äúbrag about‚Äù‚Äîjust freaking worked thousands of hours helping mostly poor people with highly necessary healthcare, but whatever. 

So I guess I‚Äôm saying If you grew up in that kind of family, you can sometimes feel this expectation of yourself to do something noteworthy and a unease or disappointment with yourself if you aren‚Äôt living up to that. 

When, in fact, being a good person living a balanced, happy life has nothing to do with fame, money, awards, etc.

I have a friend from the same type of home as me. He too felt a lot of unease doing good work but feeling unappreciated and struggling. He finally changed careers and got a job at a prestigious place‚Äîwe‚Äôll say Harvard‚Äîworking in an administrative position. His position is not a particularly powerful one‚Äîan administrative assistant‚Äîbut his parents can say braggingly ‚ÄúThomas? Oh, he works at Harvard.‚Äù It seems to have done a lot for Thomas, too, as he has stated several times that he loves his workplace. He‚Äôs surrounded by beauty (and prestige) every day, works with educated, intelligent people, and seems to fit in. So that‚Äôs why I suggested looking at a workplace of prestige. If you feel the need to do important things but can‚Äôt achieve them on your own, you can borrow the ‚Äúimportance‚Äù by doing modest thing at important places. 

Meanwhile, though, as you grow, I hope you come to feel satisfied and happy with being one of however many billion Earthlings, getting to know some of them, and appreciating all that you have. It sounds like you know you have a wonderful, loving family and feel lucky to have them‚Äîso that‚Äôs a great start."
,,,,,,,"Also, I wanted to throw this in‚Äî ‚ÄúI have no interest in things and no energy‚Äù and so on are red flags for depression, as I‚Äôm sure you know. I have been there, my friend‚ÄîI mean rock bottom. I had to start regular therapy and somehow find the energy to drag myself out of bed and outside. While outside, sitting there, not moving for hours, I started noticing the natural world. It took ages. It was mostly the birds. I started looking at them and you know‚Äîwhile I was watching them, I got out of my own head and stopped thinking about me. It sounds like a terrible cliche but it‚Äôs true. I didn‚Äôt even have thoughts in words. I just watched the birds. Then (with therapy too) I started feeling enough energy to try to learn about them, taking pictures of them. Yes, I became one of those people. But birds saved me. I once read a post by someone else who said the same thing. It doesn‚Äôt have to be birds but it would help is it was not electronic and to do with the natural world. Getting out of your own head and really seeing the (non-people) world around you works miracles. And then, when you‚Äôre ready for the people world again, awesome. But come back periodically and recharge, my friend. The natural world is where it‚Äôs at and it will always be there for you."
,,LedLenson,,,,,"Yes that‚Äôs what I thought you meant. Same in my family and all my friends. Everyone was basically indoctrinated into becoming academics and that, that is your life purpose.

I will think about that prestige idea actually."
,,LedLenson,,,,,"I know they are red flags for depression.. it started when I started losing hope in love and other things.. since 2017/2018 things have gone downhill. I have made a career and graduated etc. but my view of women is terrible, I started searching for thrills/emotional high junkie-behavior and pushing away suicide thoughts and panic attacks with alcohol, shopping, overeating, obsessing with whatever stuff I could dig into‚Ä¶ sometime around 2019 I really thought my life was over and had daily panic attacks and thought about ways to kill myself‚Ä¶ but it got better through training over excessively (not really healthy), meditation and not drinking and shopping at all. I even went to Alcoholics Anonymous and spoke to my therapist about my alcohol use but I don‚Äôt have the apparent Physical addiction, rather I can‚Äôt stand the emotions of having to be alive and always search for ways to push away my feelings‚Ä¶ it went better during the pandemic for a while when I took it slower and as I said focused on meditating and taking long walks‚Ä¶ 

but now I have this stress coming closer.. I‚Äôm getting closer to 30, have no hobbies (except working out and powerlifting sports but I‚Äôm embarrassed about it because I don‚Äôt want to be looked at as an brainless gym meatheads who only understands bicep curls and proteinshakes when everyone around me looks down on such people and only speaks about academic stuff. I also have no career or even a job, no interest in even casually seducing women anymore like I used to be obsessed with for several years. Even if it‚Äôs a hot girl asking me to come over to her place I just look at her messages and feel nothing or despise her and think ‚Äúsex is useless and if we ever start dating she will just cheat on me/leave me like has happened to all of my friends and me several times in the past‚Äù and we are not ugly guys by any means.. I don‚Äôt know if any of this makes sense..

I am aware that I am depressed as hell and I don‚Äôt really see a way out and I feel like it‚Äôs going downwards but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I search for new jobs every day.. but I don‚Äôt really want them, I never call or email to follow up and seem interested and I am embarrassed over the shitty loser job titles that im qualified for.. im confused.

One part of me want it to say on linkedin or for people to know that I am a ‚Äúbusiness analyst corporate finance chief officer blablabla title‚Äù at Bank of Scotland because it‚Äôs hard to get the job and the education and grades etc. But on the other hand, I know a lot of people who work in such places and I don‚Äôt even like finance and excel and accounting, I don‚Äôt like the people there, I don‚Äôt want to work from 7am to 22pm every day, I also don‚Äôt have the right education or grades to get there‚Ä¶ yeah I‚Äôm just so confused about what to do‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm jealous and bitter of my friends having found jobs they like‚Ä¶ one is happy as a programmer, one as a real estate broker, one as an engineer, one as a graphic designer, one as a security body guard and so on‚Ä¶ I see the fire in them when they speak about it. I want to feel that way too but can‚Äôt pick anything and feel like I have no energy or interest to pursue anything‚Ä¶. :("
,,,,,,,"Sounds like concentrating on the mental health and wellness is key right now. If you are supported by someone like your parents, having an honest talk with them about what you are feeling may lead to them helping you stay afloat while you get back to a healthy place. Job hunting while super depressed doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea. It‚Äôs already a depressing enough task in the first place for someone in a healthy state of mind. So if you can, ease up on that and get some help to just be healthy, not employed at the moment. I find it helps to treat myself like I would a dear friend or someone else
I loved. In other words, don‚Äôt let yourself speak badly about yourself (even  in your head). Interrupt that kind of thinking and immediately correct it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unemployed, unmotivated, and I might be an addict and ‚Äî‚Äú becomes ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been going through some hard times and lots of growing. But I‚Äôm loved and I‚Äôm taking steps to get better.‚Äù Repeat, repeat. And get that help. 

Wishing you many better days, good days, and great days in the future. Jobs and relationships will follow when you are healthy and on the right path."

,,salsameowww,,,,,"I'm assuming that you applied to entry level positions at libraries, since you hold an MA in Library Science, is that right? Did that not work out? For someone as educated as you are, and with experience working in an office setting for three years - it's the perfect time to get a new job!

I'm working on the same! I'll tell you what I'm doing in case its helpful: 

I've worked as an Office Manager at a law firm for three years ( I also have a BA in English) and I'm ready to move on. I'm considering applying to Communications roles with the state gov. I reached out to a career counselor to assist me in re-writing/re-working my resume and cover letter. I'm also working on an online webpage/portfolio for the few written pieces I have. I'm hoping to apply to new roles in January/February. 

I would suggest looking into comms roles as well, or how about paralegal work? Like I said, I work at a law firm and our Paralegals are kept plenty busy and stimulated everyday. I honestly regret not becoming a paralegal! It'll definitely utilize your skills in English (lots of writing) and library science (lots of research). Attorneys respect those with attention to detail."
,,hetty_sorrel,,,,,"I think not having enough work to do is common when someone starts in the workforce or when they make a shift like you did from retail to what you're doing now.

(I feel your pain üò© I'm a chemist and in my first post-undergrad job, I was put under the admin and expected to make copies, send faxes, and make place cards for meetings. I'd been told the job would be working with some senior chemists, but they just kept telling me they didn't have any work for me. I left after 4 months.)

You didn't get a BA and then an MS to clean up tables after meetings. There's nothing wrong with doing that, but it's not what you put in all that time at university for!

I would say your next step really depends on what you want to do. Do you want to stay in the banking/financial field as an admin or maybe business admin? If so, have you tried actively seeking out more work? Go to your boss and be blunt: ""I don't have anything to do today. Is there something I can help you with?"" If they say no, ask if you can check w/other departments. (Sometimes bosses don't want people to do this - they think it makes them look bad. If that's the case, I think you need to start looking.)

If you have a good relationship with your boss, let them know that this is an ongoing problem. It would be even better if you can give them some of ideas of assignments you'd like to work on.

If you'd rather not stay in this field - maybe you'd like to use your Lib Sci degree, I wouldn't worry about not being good enough for somewhere else. Just the fact that you want more responsibility is a huge plus üòâ I'd start looking. It never hurts! You make contacts and if something doesn't come thru now, it might later.

Also, find out how people in your desired field network. For example, in my field LinkedIn is essential, but that's not true for others. Good luck!"

,,BlackWidow1990,,,,,"I think the problem with me was not only the fact that I have a masters, but I was also an assistant manager at my retail job. The masters degree made them think I‚Äôd want too much money and the assistant manager part made them think I‚Äôd be unable to work under someone. 

I had gone to the career counselor when I was an undergrad and she basically made me think I ruined my whole life. She kept shaking her head that was an English major and she told me I need to move out of state if I ‚Äúreally felt a need‚Äù to major in library science. I think it all started there - I‚Äôve been discouraged in life ever since.

,,Sarah_501,,,,,"I think it's great you have made the decision to leave - Well Done! So many people, myself included, stay in the wrong job for too long and then after we've changed wonder why it took us so long! Now you've made that decision, let's address your concerns....

The guilt needs to stop NOW. How well the team functions after your departure is not your responsbility, it's the leadership's. You are doing your part by giving an adequate notice period, which from how you've phrased it of ""over a months notice"" makes me think you're giving them more notice than you are contractually obliged to. If you're still not convincing think of it this way - do you think the leadership team feel guilty they are impossible to please? Do you think they feel guilty about the lack of support you've been given and the impact it has had on your mental health? They probably don't because if they did you would be staying in this role and they would be working with your to improving things. 

Don't worry about looking like a job-hopper in your resume. Your first job was for nearly 2 years which is a good stint. You're second job has been for a start-up - a short stint at a start up isn't uncommon because things can change so rapidly at start-ups. And you're in your 20s -  it's absolutely fine for you to be finding your niche still. Also, don't think that once you've found it you'll stay in it forever - careers evolve as people evolve so there are people in their 50s still with career uncertainty!

Looking to the future, start-ups often require their team members to work quite independently and often outside their job description as stuff just needs to be done when it arises while they are still evolving and growing their team and structure. I've heard of this leaving many people feeling unsupported in that kind of environment. If you think you do better with more direction and mentorship perhaps look for jobs in more established organisations for your next move."

Once thought unhackable because hackers need to control/access 51+% of nodes in a network, it is being done and money is being stolen ($2B since 2017,  [Once hailed as unhackable, blockchains are now getting hacked | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/02/19/239592/once-hailed-as-unhackable-blockchains-are-now-getting-hacked/) ). Cryptography may be a skill to consider investing in as data privacy is a significant issue in finance.

Fintech companies are certain growing quickly, but I don't know if technology progression is really going to cause any major shifts there. Major banks are certainly moving to or leveraging the fintech business model by using AI. I'm not sure how mature their progression is, but they have a lot of resources at their disposal. They may choose to acquire growing fintech startups/companies as well so playing a role in product management is possible, which means being able to strategize and lead large programs. 

&#x200B;

While Fintech is maturing and consolidating, proptech (property tech) is certainly growing so I imagine ML/AI may be helpful there especially when it comes to underwriting and general communication between buyers, sellers, title companies, lawyers, banks, etc. As a recent homebuyer, I can't believe how backwards the residential real estate industry is."

Also, stop doing unpaid overtime. Doing unpaid overtime is a the worst thing to do. Your boss never acknowledges it, e.g. it was voluntary, and once you've done it, its impossible to get back. Make up appointments or other important commitments to get out of OT.

,,turnipfairymagic,,,,,"Training, training and development, learning and development. My company uses Learning and Development as the dept name. We also have trainers for customer service and claims specifically that are separate from our L & D team. 

At my company L & D covers educating employees on a number of things (time management, making meetings matter, delivering messages efficiently, conflict management, etc) they also run our orientation, coordinate leadership development programs, and manage our online learning (security trainings, privacy trainings etc) basically any employee education goes through them!"
,,alexkayownsabus,,,,,"It depends on the company but my personal story is that I got into a contract role within an IT Program Management Office. The director liked me and after a year I was converted to a full time project manager. I have always been someone very interested with technology and I learn quickly but I am in no way shape or form a coder/programmer. I got my degree in Art History, lol (really paying in dividends now /s)

The job requires organization, people skills, the ability to influence others, manage conflict, to grasp technical concepts (different from being able to execute them) but everything else about project management can be taught and learned. 

If you want to go the project management route you should play to your strengths and seek out project management jobs in healthcare or insurance adjacent industries. Your experience with the related field of claims adjustments is a plus. But there‚Äôs also nothing stopping you from putting yourself forward for IT PM jobs as well - just be prepared to sell your existing skills in a way that plays to your strengths without trying to hide your lack of experience directly with IT. Technical skills as a project manager don‚Äôt matter much in practice, they just may help in your ability to root out BS and know when someone is trying to stall or avoid work.

I do still recommend pursuing Account Manager or Rep roles perhaps in a software company. It utilizes PM skill sets as well so you can potentially pivot between the two in the future.

Hope this all helps!"

,,thejezzajc,,,,,"In terms of the job you've just started, I wouldn't let that stand in your way.  You'll regret it if you pass this up just because of a misplaced sense of loyalty to somewhere you've only been a short while.  Dream jobs come up rarely, and not often at convenient times.

You've also mentioned moving city.  Whether you're prepared to do this really depends on what is important to you.  Would moving make you miserable, even if it's your dream job?"
,,DrYIMBY,,,,,Go do it.
,,CTdragon,,,,,"Please re-read your own words:  

 ""But the work itself isn't necessarily my forte, or my main interest. I'd rather be working on engineering a single type of product that I believe in (like when I was doing solar), or doing R&D rather than consulting ""

&#x200B;

Sheryl Sandberg would likely say, Lean In (meaning apply for the NASA job).  

my view is you should always advocate for yourself.  which would you most regret?  taking a chance and discovering if the NASA work and Houston is a good fit, actually IS your dream job or staying where you are, as an electrical engineering consultant?  

you might consider looking at, talking to EE consultants at your current firm and asking yourself if that's what you want to be (say a decade from now).    or just apply for the NASA position and IF you get it, and you need to leave your current job, it's not uncommon to leave after a short stint, just tell them it's not the best fit for you.  at that future point, you'd have been there long enough to assess that it is / isn't for you.

lastly, i do agree with other commenters here, that a sense of loyalty to your current firm is misplaced.  you only just started this job.  plus, getting laid off for a former job should impress upon you that employers don't actually have any loyalty to you (or any of us).  the former employer/internship laid you off, right?  that's what businesses do, when they no longer need your labor (an aside:  I've been laid off three times in 30+ years, always found new positions and same for friends of my same age. getting laid off is par for the course -  ""it's just business"").  so TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, first and foremost."
,,hellome_itsmeagain,,,,,"Moving would suck, as I knew I wanted my current city/state to be my forever home years before coming here. I've never had any interest in moving to Houston lol. So even if I get this job I'd do so with the intention to move back here eventually when I want to start a family, or when my future kids start school. 

However, there's nothing particularly awful about Houston, and getting experience living somewhere else is a good thing to do while I'm young. Also, my boyfriend has already said he'd sell his house as soon as they offered me the job and move with me, so I won't have to deal with the heartbreak of choosing a job over a relationship (and fortunately this job would pay enough for me to support both of us, and he's unemployed right now anyway so it's not like I'd be forcing him to choose me or his job either.) I can't imagine I'd be miserable anywhere if I have him with me and am getting a raise to do a fucking awesome job."
,,thejezzajc,,,,,Sounds like you've answered your own objections!
,,hellome_itsmeagain,,,,,"I guess I'm just scared of the possibility of my life being completely uprooted again, so soon after I thought I had it sorted out and the waters were finally calming after the traumatic mass layoff at my previous company (which was timed horribly in the context of my personal life - it was only 3 months after my divorce was finalized, moving twice in a span of 6 months, and recently quit grad school because I had no money). 

What if I don't get the job? What if I do? Then there's the possibility that it isn't everything I hoped, or that it is but I'm not good enough to do the job well, or, or, or, or. Also I would feel bad for being that employee who leaves when they just started at a company, I like this current job well enough."
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"Start at the start.  Sounds like just now you have one decision to make: should you apply for the job or not?

What do you have to lose by applying?  You're not committing yourself to anything yet. 

And if you don't apply, are you likely to be kicking yourself in the future for not doing so? 

I'm not saying you have to apply.  I'm just giving you some thoughts about what would be going through my head."

,,NumerousImprovements,,,,,"I‚Äôm gunning to be a team leader or manager in the bank where I work. 72k AUD minimum for leader, I think 96k for a group 3 Lead. Manager $140k and above. Management would probably not be included in this but I currently make 60k doing a fairly cruisey job just processing backend forms and making shit happen. Listen to music while I do it, have a chat with people. And leadership for me anyway doesn‚Äôt seem stressful, it seems fun. I‚Äôve had leadership roles here and there and stepped up before, studied management and leadership as well as business. At my bank, I can earn up to $135k I think by being a lead (higher team leader) and that job sounds interesting and exciting to me. 

Reason I say this; I know people who couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse than people leading. It‚Äôs going to come down to you largely. There are some roles out there that will come with inherent stresses I guess but it‚Äôs going to come down to your preference and also your aptitude for dealing with stress. Also, what are the things that set of your alarm bells and cause you to start stressing? Steer clear. 

That being said, I do think people leading is a very interesting path. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily require qualifications unless you‚Äôre leading a specialised team or maybe a scrum master/project lead role. Day to day is going to be different and if the culture‚Äôs good, you‚Äôll have a tonne of exciting challenges that you set yourself (which would therefore hopefully mean you aren‚Äôt stressed about them, but rather motivated instead).

That doesn't necessarily mean taking a pay cut, though. My advice: The higher on the pay scale a job is, the more likely a company is to hire someone known to them. Blindly sending your CV out is not a good strategy. Get out there and meet with people that are on a path they enjoy. Buy them a cup of coffee, listen to their advice, ask how you can help them and see who else they know that might be able to provide a path to something better. Each person likely has 2-3 contacts they can introduce you to, so if you do 2 meetings a week, you'll meet a lot of new people. 

Also: Make a list of what's important to you and do an honest assessment of your expenses. Then quit."

,,RyeGiggs,,,,,"I have 2 experiences.

First is an employee who started with 0 experience so started at a Jr. level. He has worked for 5 years in that role and had some small pay bumps and moved to a Sr. at the same position. The Sr. level basically means he can work independently, generally doesn't need help and can help others in similar positions. But 50% of his job could be replaced by a Jr. person.  He wants more comp, I don't need anymore people in the position directly above his.  I want him to move to a supervisor or client relations type position.  We are stuck, I can't help him, he can only wait for the lifer's ahead of him to die and wait for what ever pay bands HR decides are appropriate for his current role.

When I was promoted twice in a few months.  I did not want that role, they wanted me to do it.  I sat down with the Manager and told him what I was NOT willing to do that the predecessor was doing. He moved the responsibilities among the others and I got exactly the position I asked for.

The ball is in your court, take one of those two positions and fix the work life balance problem. Ask for an interview and ask to know why the previous people were leaving then follow up with how the company is going to change the role to deal with it. Let them know that work life balance is a major concern for you.  Ask for more vacation time if you can't get away from on call or overtime.

Good luck!"

I dont think its going to work like that. Due to the nature of the job and that it consolidates for the entire company a LOT of items/special requests by default just have to go though the person in this role. I cant just say OK i dont want to do XYZ, whos going to do it? Jim in department X that doesnt know anything about it? Its going to unfortunately go though this role. 

Related to above even if i could negotiate the position (which i cant), I still never actually did the job, as such, there are a lot of hidden gems I dont know about sitting where I am. I cant get rid of things i dont know about yet. If i did the job for a few months and could get a good look at the role and chop things away that could be a ""thing"" but no company would ever let someone chop away responsibilities to begin with and 100% certainly wouldnt let someone work a role for a few months so they could see what parts they want to get rid of when negotiating.  

Also, i actually like my job. I enjoy my work. Thats HUUUGE!!!! Id really hate to go backwards and start working a role that i now dislike. Then what? Now i got to leave the company and go somewhere else and possibly get another job I dont like or a company I dont like, or start commuting really far again. I just want to continue doing what I like. I finally found a job I enjoy and its had wonders on my life and mental health.

My career changes have been tangential from business knowledge learned on the job. I got a glimpse of project management when I was in IT.

My next role went into research, where I filled a jack of all trades role with projects, databases, application support, all able to be draw from previous experience. While working in research, I did my masters in statistics because I really enjoyed working with data and it was a common thread in my early career. After I got my degree, I got a role as a statistician and haven‚Äôt changed since.

My current role has a wide range of activities and responsibilities, including analysis, designing experiments, consultation, project management, stakeholder management.

Of all my career changes, the only intentional change was becoming a statistician. I was laid off after being in IT. Found a job doing project work (and I was desperate for any role after being of work for nearly a year). I felt like I didn‚Äôt want to go further in that role at that time, so I was lucky to get a referral from a previous co-worker to work in research.

Got my foot in the door at one of them and really focused on learning the engineering and tools/systems side of the business as an Engineering PM.  The sales side really helped bridge development and engineering work and focusing on business outcomes.

Don't get attached to this job, don't interact with your boss beyond what's required, and certainly don't push yourself for the sake of matching the work hours of other brainwashed losers. 12 hours is way too much everyday for the undervalued salary they give and not worth your long term physical and mental health.

,,tamilnibba,,,,,"At the outset, thank you so much for your well wishes.  


With regards to my a\*\*hole manager. Yeah, he just doesn't stand up for himself at all. I've started to act like a notice period employee now.

Another incident happened two months ago. We have a hybrid model - 3 days office and 2 days WFH, in a week. This is not strictly followed by everyone. I am really close to 2 of my coworkers who work under the same Manager. So, whenever I take WFH on days mandated to be in office, these people used to take WFH too. My manager stays in Mumbai and he has no visibility. Someone complained to him. He could have simply called me and addressed. But no, he's passive aggressive AF. He waited for me to request WFH. Unfortunately, I had sprained my ankle badly and I asked him for 1 week WFH. He started shouting at me over call and told me that ""I don't care how you reach office, I cannot give WFH anymore, you should take leave"". This was after telling him that I'm mentally capable of doing work and that this being a tech company, should facilitate such requests. Ever since, my relationship with him has never been the same. I've been taking leaves since then when it could have been simply WFH. Do note that I come all the way to office just to remotely talk to some internal stakeholders.

Seriously he's gagging on that Corporate overlords' lunds

UPDATE: he told me that he's taken up the issue with his manager. But after this incident, I don't wanna work under him.

For me it‚Äôs helping and teaching people. Also problem solving but only when it‚Äôs a problem someone cares about. 

People seem to think I like tech or working on computers but I don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just one of the most powerful tools available to help people.

,,TheCRab22,,,,,"Burnout is an occupational hazard. Though personal factors do play a role in burnout, environmental factors/ your workplace plays a huge role in your burnout. 

I'd expect that changing jobs may help with your burnout. If the job is in the same industry and the culture is still the same at this new job, expect to have the same outcomes. 

I appreciate how people suggest finding fulfillment in what you are doing. True engagement in your work helps those that are feeling burnt out. 

Many people suggest learning coping skills and wellness to address burnout. Though those help, that's not going to fully address the burnout. You are just addressing the symptoms. You need systemic and organizational change to fully address burnout. 

In terms of your therapist helping you with burnout, I have some feedback, as I am a therapist that treats burnout. Therapy takes time. And progress isn't linear. You go all over the place until you get to where you need to go. You have to trust the process. If you don't think that it's going to work or help, you may be wasting your time, energy, and money. The therapeutic relationship or your relationship with a therapist may be an issue. If you don't feel comfortable with your therapist, there's a strong possibility that you might not get the outcomes that you want."

I was really worried that I was just overall done with caring too much about work and that that would impact my new job. As is turns out, I love my new job. I feel motivated and invigorated in a way I haven‚Äôt been in many years. Even though I‚Äôm working harder and more hours now, I have considerably more energy throughout the day and am even more productive outside of work. Even my sleep is better. I didn‚Äôt know until I left that last job just how much life it was sucking out of me. Good luck with your new job. I hope you love it!"
,,Designer-Expert-5085,,,,,Thank you. This is good advice. I have lots of hobbies and projects. None of them seem to interest me lately.

,,Designer-Expert-5085,,,,,"I see people post on here often questions along the lines of ""My job isn't fulfilling"" or ""I'm not passionate about my work"" etc. There are generally two types of people that respond:   
1) ""Work is not supposed to be someone you're passionate about or fulfilled by, it is just a paycheck, a means to an end""

2) ""If you aren't fulfilled and passionate about your job, leave and find another one until you do""

,,Designer-Expert-5085,,,,,"You're welcome. I am glad to see this getting a decent amount of responses. It's actually been SUPER helpful for me to real all these comments, digest, and put together thoughtful replies.   


The exercise of posting this question, reading the comments, then thoughtfully replying is making me feel much more positive and optimistic, but more importantly, it is giving me clarity and structure around my thoughts and feelings toward the situation.   


Thank you everyone for the replies."
,,Designer-Expert-5085,,,,,"Thank you for your thoughtful response. I particularly resonate with your statement about how learning coping skills and wellness only address the symptoms. 

Luckily the new job is completely different from my current one in almost every way, so I am optimistic I'll have a different outcome in a new job. 

Also great points about the therapy. Perhaps I could lean-in a bit more and trusting the process will help towards resolutions. Luckily I do trust my therapist quite well, it just seems that we don't focus on the things I was hoping to discuss. For my upcoming session in three days, I sent an email outlining what I would like to talk about, why, and what I hope the outcomes to be from the conversation. Hopefully that isn't too prescriptive (or overbearing) from my part."
,,Designer-Expert-5085,,,,,Thank you. This is exactly what I am hoping for. This gives me some much needed hope that the grass will be greener.
,,Tony_the-Tigger,,,,,"From your replies, you sound a little... adrift?

What about your current job don't you like?  What about the new job is drawing you to it?  

If the problem is that you're craving social connection, are there any local (or semi-local) communities for any of your hobbies you can meet up with?

You mention seeing a therapist in another comment.  That's good.  Just remember, if it feels like you're not really getting anywhere, they might not be the right fit for you, and that's OK.

It's OK to want the work you do to be meaningful and have some part in making the world (or even just your employer) a better place.  It's also okay to eschew that and work with the understanding that you're simply trading time for money to fund the rest of your life.  Finally, it's OK for that feeling to shift from time to time.

Finally, sometimes all you need is just a change of scenery.  If you think it'll help, maybe take some time between one job and the next to refresh the area around your workspace so it's a little different when you start the new job.  Rearrange the room, get some new decorations, different lighting, a new plant maybe."
,,DonJuanDoja,,,,,"Me too. I didn‚Äôt get it from the quote. I got it from watching people I care about destroy themselves with their own thoughts and feelings.

Just remember there‚Äôs no guarantee that‚Äôll be the one. 

Job hopping is ok temporarily if you need to find the right place.

Good luck!"
,,WackyWeiner,,,,,You should take a chance. Otherwise you dont have a chance. üò≥ I hope it works out for you too. üëç
,,TheCRab22,,,,,"My experience treating burnout comes from treating the medical field but burnout is burnout, no matter the field. In that field, pushing wellness modules and self-care tactics is their way of addressing burnout. Most organizations make burnout an individual problem versus an organizational issue. Organizations make it a 'personal problem' as opposed to changing their own culture.

I'm glad you trust your therapist. Different therapists have different styles, which fit different people. Depending on your therapist style, treatment could be highly structured or it could be very free flowing. I'd like to think that your therapist has a customized treatment plan for you. 

My website may have some blogs that may be helpful to you. If you check out the website, disregard the first part of all titles. Just focus on the second part."

In terms of further education, I would try to identify a handful of jobs you are interested in and go from there. Some roles, especially entry level roles, require little to no education.

Jobs and training for jobs tend to aggregate in bigger population centers.  I live in the most expensive area in California and met transplants and people passing through from all over.  I've met and are friends with double digit number of people from Connecticut.  I've never met anyone from Mississippi.  Met one person from Louisiana.

Probably few people do, so don't feel bad about it. Are there any downsides to just studying part time (or even reducing your work hours till you finish your degree)? Studying part time would also buy you time to figure out if you want to do a Masters, and what in."
,,eddytheflow,,,,,"I've been taking a single masters course over the span of maybe 2 years with a FT job. Not once after taking that first class did I ever feel like I wanted to take 2 let alone 3 classes in tandem. So applaud you on the mental strength to do what you've been doing so far. It's a rough balance I'm sure. 

I think it's a pretty personal question. For me, I chugged along slowly because I did a lot of self-learning at my FT job, working in a pretty relaxed environment. Sure I wanted to get the hell out but I could stand it and was not necessarily in a huge rush. 

For you.. there are a lot of variables to consider aren't there? Maybe you just need to talk it out to yourself. How important is a good GPA for your future job/higher education prospects? Do you have the option to switch to a PT job? Is your family reliant on your income? Weigh your needs with your wants, and consider your mental health and rest!

To elaborate on my choice again, I had income and benefits at an easy job that allowed for self-study and I prioritized keeping a job over completing my degree faster. I could have taken 2 classes but did not want to go thru that added stress."

This is going to sound harsh af, and I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt say it in a way that isn‚Äôt, and please be aware this is an opinion informed by observation, and I don‚Äôt like these things, I just believe them to be true.

If you‚Äôre an attractive, but not quite ‚Äúrunway material who should already be the new face of Revlon‚Äù woman, your sales will be great. Women will be more comfortable dealing with another woman and yet not quite threatened by your looks. Men will respond positively because they want to have sex with you.

If you‚Äôre either obviously unattractive or over-the-top attractive, your results will likely suffer. Unattractiveness will hurt you for obvious reasons, but the disadvantage for highly-attractive women is this: Women are jealous of insanely-hot women, and guys are intimidated by them. Either one is a bad thing for sales.

All that said, right now is a bad time to be a car salesperson. Dealership lots are half empty; they got nothing to sell. In a year or two though, when the inventory comes back up, all the people that have been waiting to buy new cars are going to start doing just that."

It's rare to get weekends off. It's not uncommon to not have two days in a row off. You'll work every holiday. Every New Year's Eve (month-end!). Some months you'll only earn draw, and if you do that too many times, you're out. Some months you'll earn bank - rolling in it. You have to learn to live frugally all the time, and save during the good months. Most dealerships are cut throat - your coworkers will happily shank you for a sale. And every customer is positive that there are thousands upon thousands of extra $ tacked on to the price and that they are smart enough to make you bring it down. They will not hesitate to be rude, and to lie to your sales manager (""but OP told me she'd throw in mats for free""). But, if you try long enough, you might get lucky enough to find a team that has your back. And a manager who will fight on your behalf. And if all the cards fall into alignment, your yearly pay can reach the six digits."

You do have some fears , may be of not doing well or you are overly focused of being right. The attitude is right but the process you are following is wrong. It can lead you to stress, anxiety and burnout. You need to become confident at your workplace, with your duties, towards your colleagues, subordinates and managers. How to do that as these things are not taught at the Uni. Take guidance from life/career  coaches or other professionals. They will teach you and guide you how to deal with your work situation and be confident. You are the only one feelings like this. There  are so many like you who come to me for guidance.

Having said that, I‚Äôve still been active on some key Skype and Teams meetings and have been trying to keep up with emails and provide updates on projects. So it‚Äôs not like I just disappeared.  Just wanted to know what people in my position usually do and what‚Äôs traditionally expected.  I would think that the death of a close relative would be a reasonable justification for taking time off to grieve with family.  In the grand scheme of things, 5 business days seems like a small sacrifice for an employee to get their head straight and recover from the loss."
,,MissKatmandu,,,,,"It depends on the organization, I don't think there's an overall cultural expectation. I agree with you from a human standpoint. 

My employer's official bereavement policy--5 days for immediate family, 3 for extended. Any additional time comes from your other PTO (personal/vacation time) unless you plan on working remotely during the additional time. There are rarely times when HR will reach out to all staff asking for voluntary donation of vacation days if someone had an unexpected or tragic loss (such as a young child) as a way to help.

,,ccrondon,,,,,"I'm not an expert on the topic since I've just been allocated to a Cybersecurity team after working for a while in Data Quality - I will only share the approach I'm currently taking to it, as suggested by my peers. If you already have any type of experience in CS you can make do without a degree (for junior positions, probably not senior) - what I would suggest you focus on is get a certification such as CISM so you can get a high-level understanding of the field, and if you're interested in a deeper dive I would say you could look for a CISSP cert. These are just two of them, there are tons of other useful courses and certifications you can take advantage of - but you probably won't go wrong by doing these."
,,Mutand1s,,,,,"Coincidentally, I‚Äôm a former mechanic who moved into Service Writing, then temp/contract jobs with technical contracts and ultimately I was hired by one of the companies I contracted for and I‚Äôve been involved in cyber security for the last 10 years. I‚Äôm not too keen on sharing all my personal details publicly, but feel free to PM me and I‚Äôm happy to offer advice."
,,mlcarson,,,,,"Cybersecurity is typically not an entry level job.   It requires a programming, system administrator, and/or networking background and preferably all three.  That's why it's a high paying position.   If you have an expert in the field willing to mentor you, I'm sure you can bypass a lot of the background hurdles.   There's a reason that a CISSP cert requires 5 years experience.  Companies are not going to trust their IT security to somebody without this experience.  

Probably the quickest  way of getting into the field is via an auditing firm where your learning from coworkers and doing low level things like vulnerability scans and auditing security policy/procedures.  I have no idea how easy or difficult that would be but if it can be done then you gain valuable experience directly in your field and can then get some certs to back up the experience and could then apply for jobs outside the auditing field.

If I were you though, I'd try to leverage my mechanic background and start my own business. rather than trying to get into cybersecurity.  Being the boss of your own company would be much more rewarding in the long run."

,,,,,,,cs but u gotta deliver
,,GEN_Z1,,,,,"I think I have a plan for you. Work hard and study hard in CS. Go to a reputable university and complete your undergrad (Bachelor of Science) in CS with a really good CGPA the higher the better. After you graduate you can work as a software engineer/ CS related careers and obtain your PR status. Then you could apply to Med school it would be easier to get in since you are no longer a international student and most med school don't require you to have any background in biology. I can only speak for med schools in Canada but if work hard you can definitely chase your dreams and follow your passion. Best of luck to you. The unfortunate thing is that humans are unpredictable you may not like the things you like now 10 years down the road.  I don't know how passionate you are towards being a medical doctor. Since it takes at least 7 years to be a GP after you finish your undergrad. 4 years of Med school and 3 years residence. To specialize in psychiatry you will probably need a longer residency training. This is a lot of work and a lot of money. Do you have other plans for your life like getting married or having a child? How would you be able to incorporate that into your existing life? Have you thought about how old you will be after you finish all your education? Is this something that you really want to pursue and invest in? Alternatively if you are only into the psychological aspect of psychiatry maybe pursuing a career in psychology could be easier? Pursuing a career in occupational therapy? Something that incorporate your knowledge in CS and psychology since many people who worked in the CS field are constantly under pressure this could very well be a very interesting career. If this is the route that you want to take then maybe considering doing a minor/major in psychology during your undergrad? There also exist psychotherapist and counselors that also help people with metal issues and provide treatment and advice. Psychologist can do everything a psychiatrist can do but can't prescribe medicine, is that something you are okay with doing as a career? Some states/provinces you could be certified as a psychologist with a master's degree. That's probably an easier route? There are doctor level degrees like a PHD in psychology(more research) or a Psy.D (more practical) that enables you to get the title ""Dr."" this varies by states/province. If you really want prescription power some states in U.S.A have program for doctor level psychologist to take additional courses(in pharmacology) to get prescription rights. The are called prescribing psychologist which are almost equivalent as a psychiatrist but you are limited to practice in specific states in US. All of that said this is only current as of now and things might change in the next few years and it is un predictable but you there is nothing wrong to plan early.  Also one last note education in Canada/US most of the time are cross recognized especially if they are reputable.(try to avoid community college) You should have no problem transferring you  education credentials however each state and province have their own regulations and policies for registering and certifying professions so you might have to take additional exams(generally around ethics) or additional courses/training to be certified and practice at a different location."

Nevertheless, international students do occasionally attend U.S. medical schools, so premeds applying from outside of the U.S. should do careful research to find out which schools are open to international students and have a long history of admitting these students, experts suggest.  
Dr. Sahil Mehta, founder of the MedSchoolCoach admissions consulting firm based in Massachusetts, says the ""absolute best place to start"" the search for international-friendly institutions is by looking at the Medical School Admission Requirements database on the Association of American Medical Colleges website."

,,0_o-beepboop,,,,,Women are naturally attracted to work places where they won‚Äôt be harassed by men.

These are what I've experienced in my male majority workplace all by the same male. Of course there are more instances, but I figured this would at least be a good example.

SkullAngel001 is right in what he's said.   Academia and government is doing everything it can to promote the Computer Science field to girls at an early age and it's not working.   We don't need equal outcomes with respect to global demographics and any field of study.  People gravitate to what they find the most interesting.  As long as women (or any demographic group) isn't being discriminated against -- things are fine.   You certainly can't raise the discrimination card when women are given preference by most hiring managers these days for diversity reasons.  Giving any group preference is by definition discriminating against a different group.   This generally doesn't end well for anybody."

It‚Äôs subtle but it can be enough to stop girls from pursuing computer science when they‚Äôre deciding between two similar subjects, say another engineering field with higher ratios of women vs computer science."

A higher-up at my company got credit for something that I (a lowly administrator) did.,kioqyw,mysterious_cactus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/kioqyw/a_higherup_at_my_company_got_credit_for_something/,8,6,1608708972.0,
,,SkullAngel001,,,,,"You could try the following but it could be risky if your boss is an asshat who micromanages and takes credit for subordinates' work. 

If you encounter one of the higher up managers/directors (above your boss), mention to him/her what happened and ask if the organization has a representative or system set up to specifically accommodate multilingual clients. You pitch it in a constructive and curious way (like you're trying to pitch an innovative idea) and you don't mention your asshat boss and don't shame him for taking credit (you don't want to seem vengeful & petty). 

The idea is so you're recognized as the person who is truly the recipient of the credit while demonstrating initiative. 

As for your fruitless job hunting efforts, if you're not getting phone calls or emails from recruiters and HR managers, you need to examine your execution. That is, look at your resume and see what could be tweaked/optimized (show it to friends/family for critique or post it on r/resumes). Look at the jobs you're applying for; are you first one or the umpteenth application? Do your qualifications meet 70-90% of the job tasks you're applying for or less? 

&#x200B;

> I have already been applying and falling interviews for the last 12 months or more. 

If you're having difficulty with interviews, get a friend or family member to do mock interviews with you, so you can practice your execution. He/she can also critique your answers and body language. Even if it's a Zoom mock interview, it's still good practice."
,,,,,,,"Have you had any job performance reviews and if so, what have they said? And were any of the communications of thanks sent via email? I would say print out any emails you receive that show you went above and beyond in your job. And who did you request a raise with?

What's the point of employee referrals if the company won't even talk to you?,jk3zsa,SkinnyFatGuy20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/jk3zsa/whats_the_point_of_employee_referrals_if_the/,8,4,1603947466.0,
,,kj_jayhawk,,,,,"One thing a lot of people don't realize is that at most companies, even if you are referred, you still have to apply to a job so they can match you up to a position within their application tracking system. I think most people assume if they've been referred they don't have to do anything else and the company will just automatically reach out - unfortunately this is not true. I used to work in talent acquisition for a huge fortune 5 company and the reality of the referral process is that it's really broken. 

People would get referred all the time, but if they haven't applied to a specific job then all it does in the system is place a symbol on their profile to say ""this person has been referred by an employee"" - it doesn't automatically tie your profile to a job you are a fit for, or that you were referred to, nor does it bump you to the front of the line or give you any additional 'credit' on your application. Honestly, the onus is entirely on the recruiter to seek out people that have been referred and that's not always easy to identify. That's why it feels like when  you get referred and aren't getting noticed, you likely aren't. It's messed up. 

And it's frustrating because I was in charge of internal emails at the company really pushing employees to refer, refer, refer. I  hated sending those emails each month because we invariably got a lot of email responses saying ""I have referred x number of people and none of them have ever been hired."" Companies say it is usually a huge source of new employees but in the US at least, it really isn't. I will say, in countries like India, referrals were absolutely a huge part of hiring but that is because someone was referred, they walk into the office and get hired same day. The system and process is very different. 

So, long story short, unfortunately if you are in the U.S., being referred to a job online isn't the most helpful because for large companies your information can easily get lost amongst the thousands of profiles and job applications in the system. The best way to get a foot in the door from a referral is to reach out and talk to someone you know at that company directly or via LinkedIn, and have them help you potentially track down a recruiter who specializes in the types of roles you are interested in. Getting your name in front of that person and letting them know of your interest is likely to work better than just putting your hopes in an online referral that may get buried within the application system."
,,sharknado523,,,,,"Tell me about it. I am at a company that, long story short, just went through a corporate merger and this place is a sinking ship. We merged with a competitor that was far less profitable and they're going to spend years cleaning up this mess. March 2020 was not a good time to do a complicated merger.

I know people who have left my company and gotten other jobs. They all recommended me highly and I got immediate rejection emails.

It's a tough job market out there right now. I've been getting some pretty insulting offers from people who find my r√©sum√© on job boards. Why would you even call me about an entry level $13/hr 3 month independent contractor position with a possibility of going full time when I currently have a six-figure full-time position? Like I know these people are just doing their job but that's just dumb."
,,SkinnyFatGuy20,,,,,"That makes sense in the case of general referrals, but in my case it's always been referrals for specific positions that I've then applied for. They'll put me in their referral system and I'll get an email that says ""So and so referred you for X position, click here to apply."" So I click to apply then a week later I get an email saying ""Thanks for applying. After absolutely zero consideration we've decided to move on with other candidates."""
,,kj_jayhawk,,,,,"Yep, that‚Äôs because you apply, it puts a little ‚Äòstar‚Äô on your profile on that application, and that‚Äôs it. The recruiter could already be far down the pipeline interviewing people and putting candidates forward to the hiring manager, so even with a referral it won‚Äôt necessarily be a bump. The only way for that to work is if you get referred to and apply to a role right when it gets posted so that you are considered early on. Companies say they consider all applications while a job is posted but in reality it‚Äôs rare; especially when a lot of positions get 100s of applicants in the first few days."

I'd love to talk you through how you should make this decision, which would be more helpful, but to keep it short, think about:  
\- The bigger picture - the workplace culture of healthcare is likely very different, people who are in travel industries tend to be there because they love travel. Think about how important this is to you, short term and long term. Talk to some people in healthcare doing similar jobs, read the Glassdoor reviews for this employer, talk to some of their employees in the same department.  
\- If you leave your aviation job now, you may be leaving some job security/rights and going to a new post where you'll likely be on probationary period, less security for 1-2 years and ""last in first out"". Risks on both sides.  
\- Rumours of a wage reduction can quickly turn to actual redundancies.  
\- Some people just prefer to jump before they are pushed.  
\- But then again, sometimes a redundancy package is quite generous = possible reason to stay?  
\- Write a list of 10 potential opportunities this new job and sector could bring. How do you feel after that?  
Happy to chat about it by phone/zoom if it would help. You can easily find me on LinkedIn - Pascale Scheurer.

You need to demonstrate that you see that and can work with it. 

The only thing I would recommend you do is give D the resources she needs to not be so dependent on you. If you taught her that she can come to you at a drop at a hat and you would put everything down to assist that is a bad move. 

Find a way to make her self sufficient by giving her access to tools/reminders/training etc. If she skips that step make sure she goes back and goes through the resources provided and this will eventually get her to start being more self sufficient and confident in her work."

Like hyenas, two colleagues in earshot sniggered along with his insinuations, which made me feel even more alone. Thinking back, I should have taken that company to court for constructive dismissal but I was quite young and naive at the time.

Another time at a different company, the well-liked Head of Projects left and was replaced by this women, who decided everyone was a potential threat to her and systematically used the HR procedures to try and get rid of people she didn‚Äôt like or get on with. She created little cliques and had favourites who acted like her Consigliere‚Äôs. These people would snoop on people in the workplace and report back to her. It was awful.

I would add up the total debt you‚Äôll have by the time you finish nursing school, figure your monthly payments on the total debt(both current and future debt), then compare that to your salary with only guaranteed wage increases factored in.  If it doesn‚Äôt leave you with more money left over at the end of the month, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd do it, at least not until paying down some of the debt.

Personally I would consider if there‚Äôs not something you can do to improve your skills on your current path, while living at home and paying down your debt.  Seems like you are just very frustrated, ready to give up and try something new.  I don‚Äôt know anything about law school, so not sure how the scores and tests you mentioned will be factored, my thought is that you‚Äôll still have to apply for jobs after nursing school, and there is a chance you‚Äôll find out it‚Äôs not for you.

I don‚Äôt want to discourage from trying new things, but this honestly seems like a bit of a gamble as you‚Äôll have to pay more money up front in hopes of finding something you‚Äôll enjoy/be successful at.  If you do decide to, there will be no turning back as you‚Äôll be financially committed and not many options left if you do not complete the program or are unable to find work in the field.

I think it‚Äôs important to examine your own motive here, namely what motivated you to go to law school in the first place.  If it‚Äôs the same motivation driving you to go to nursing school, I‚Äôd be very suspicious of it, making sure it doesn‚Äôt lead you to make the same mistake twice."

I get that everyone is circlejerking nurses right now (and deservedly so), but there a lot to consider there. Nursing is a difficult career, and [even though there is demand, there are multifaceted causes for the nursing shortage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_shortage).

Salary varies a ton depending on the area, from less than you're making now to $100k+. You need to look at what hospitals in your area are paying, and how to get accredited where you want to work.

[Nursing tends to rank fairly low on job satisfaction surveys](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2017/03/13/the-unhappiest-jobs-of-2017/#52ec1004730c). Obviously that's a clickbait article, but I went out with a nurse for a few years and she was incredibly stressed. It's not an easy job. 

Also, you need to be an RN to made good money, which will take at least another two years of school at least, since it requires a practicum in most areas. It's also fairly academically rigorous, nurses take some challenging calc, human biology, and organic chem courses. The practicum is unpaid in most areas.

However, if you think you'd like it overall, go for it. Not many careers have such a real and immediate impact on people's lives."
,,ccody923,,,,,"You could try for management.  Having a degree and involvement with law could give you credentials for that.  Management will teach you valuable life skills in a short time. It goes hand and hand with law.  For me 3 years in management has changed my life approach. Taught me organization, how to cover my ass, research, excel, PowerPoint, team building, morals vs ethics, networking, persuasion, how to talk to/in front of people, being the driving force behind projects.  I could go on forever.  I started working when I was 19 and worked my way up.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what I want forever unless I keep climbing and its enjoyable.  But now I‚Äôm in my late 20s and I‚Äôm glad that this is the route I went.  It‚Äôs because of what it‚Äôs taught me.  Structure. For you it could supply an income, Benefits, and build your resume.  I‚Äôd say shoot for the big corporations.  It‚Äôs possible you could network your way into law within the company."
,,wanderlustpower,,,,,"Have you ever thought about becoming a legal assistant first then becoming a paralegal then work your way into becoming a lawyer?

I know someone who was just a receptionist/ office assistant at a law firm and then became a legal assistant through experience. Her law firm wanted her to go back to school and become a paralegal or lawyer. They were open to discussing some funding to help her through school. They also gave her end of year bonuses based on performance.

Do you have an option to move to a cheaper city? one with less taxes and lower cost of living?"

,,nemtudod,,,,,"I can weigh on in this as i chose income as a driving factor.
I had a childhood spent in poverty and learned very quickly that i could not have the same clothes, toys, summer travels etc as other kids in my class. When i went to college my parents could not support me so i had  to work and study at the same time which multiple times drove me to the brink of homelessness and i starved regularly. Mentally it brought a lot of anxiety. Fast forward to my graduation when at the job fair i was recruited into an entry analyst role, with higher than the minimal wage i was working for up to then.  This financal security opened many doors for me: started travelling, renting my own small apartment, more free time, i could afford better clothes etc. 

I can not tell you how releived i was and i felt will do anything to avoid being broke. Started saving, supporting my parents etc and kept my career on the same path, because even tho i never been the analyst type, i grew into it and learned to handle it as ‚Äújust a job‚Äù that saves me from what i went through in the first half of my life.

Tldr: i guess i hated starving."
,,ricosalsa,,,,,"I did and now I'm trying to get out. Its not worth it in the long run but in the short run you can set yourself up for success.

I am now in a position where I can get the basic necessities covered (mortgage, utilities, internet, insurance) with my side hustles and I have a 60K safety net. I that I am no longer in need of this job and plan to move onto something else that pays alot less but gives me the freedom to do more with my life. 

Tldr: Do it but for a short amount of time and set yourself up so you don't need this job anymore."

The good thing is that you haven‚Äôt wasted education on something you don‚Äôt like. Right now you can pretty much choose anything that truly interests you and go for it. Also, find some positive ways to spend your time. Look into volunteer opportunities in your area, perhaps at state parks, for example.

Just throwing loosely connected ideas in a bad and broken english XD:


- It seems that working for someone or doing something that helps other people is greatly satisfying, if that's something you care about.
- I don't know where I read this just a while ago, maybe somewhere here in Reddit: life isn't about being happy all the time, but about being the less unhappy you can be. It sounded conformist to me but now it sounds simplifying... what about looking for something you just hate less than your current job?
- I do software development from time to time and realize that I would never have known what this is really about if I had not studied it or done it. That is, the way your mind works, what makes someone good or bad on the subject, what helps you, how you can help others with what you know. Now I am looking for, within software development or IT, some sub-field(?) that I find more comfortable to me. Something good that I can mention from the area of software, IT or even technology in general is that it can be applied in any area that you like. Really. Psychology. Music, whatever you like! I think that's awesome.
- For me, thinking about working on software and at the same time on something that helps other people is just inspiring. But again, this is for me. And I will see if I get to try it soon.
- Did you ever talk about this with a good friend? Even if you didn't, think about what a best friend will say: just make a decision! Don't worry about being ""picky"". This is your life. Pick what you want to do while you can! You are not killing or stealing while being picky. It is not that bad.
- I am by no means associated with this but if you have the money (which I don't XD) and time, you can try this https://www.selfauthoring.com/ . Maybe it could help you? It was made by Jordan Peterson. If you don't know him search his lectures on youtube. He's a professor and a psychologist.

Maybe some of this helps you, I am looking for something else to do too... I hope you the best!"
,,Gardenia21,,,,,"I mean I'd love to be self employed and own my own business. But even with that option, I wouldn't know what type of product or service to sell. I feel ridiculous for being so clueless honestly. It seems people around me have their lives together and I don't. "

Putting a two weeks notice is only needed if you wanted to leave on good terms and want to use your boss as a reference.

Also your salary is then much higher for future jobs (as if you have been paid X amount before companies are more likely to offer that to you in the future). Also you could not take the job and be fired next month from your current job. Nothing is guaranteed. I would take the huge raise and just try and save most of it and about 6 months into it discuss being made permanent, then regardless of the answer search for new jobs (in case they lie to you).

Your post reads as a rambling dream scenario for something hypothetical, not probable. Call it a hunch, but I bet this Communications Advisor position will require you to do more than make PowerPoint presentations and setup dinners - and probably have a college degree. You didn‚Äôt mention whether or not you have one, but you didn‚Äôt need to. Four years ago you were a 20 year old receptionist. Now you‚Äôre a 24 year receptionist. You admit the only thing you know is what you‚Äôre doing now.

Not to sound like a dick here, but there‚Äôs a 0% chance you‚Äôre going to go from a 24 year old receptionist (that hasn‚Äôt received a raise in two years) to a 24 year old making $90k/year in a position you know nothing about.

,,Display-Dry,,,,,"Aw, I feel like I‚Äôm talking to my slightly younger self! I worked for pretty much the exact same company as you for over 4 years. < 10 employees, bosses were the owners, marketing agency, wore tons of hats, learned so much, no benefits, etc. The most I ever made was $36k. I had lots of offers for temp work for way more than I made but I turned them down solely because they were temp and I didn‚Äôt want to leave something I loved so much only to be jobless a year later. So my advice is to wait but keep applying for other jobs you are qualified for that are permanent. That‚Äôs what I did and I got my dream job at my dream company last year making almost 3x as much as I did at the little company. I still miss the little company all the time, but I enjoy making 3x as much now with less responsibilities at a mature company. Especially with the economy the way it is now, I would be wary of any temp jobs. 

But, since you haven‚Äôt gotten a raise in 2 years, I would take this time to ask for one now as well! And if another job comes along then it is what it is. You gotta look out for your best interests!"

I'd say apply. *If* you get it- but you really want to be where you are- I'd go to HR or your boss or whoever and say ""look I've got this offer...""  I was turned down for a raise at my annual review at a small business who ""couldn't afford more"" -- I absolutely LOVE my job- and they know that. So I applied at a competing place, doing the same job offering 13k more plus benefits and 10 month contracts instead of 12 where I am. Once I got a job offer I came BACK to HR and spoke to them about it. They had a leg up when they knew that I loved my job and would never leave, but ironically- faced with me actually leaving- they were able to find the 5K I had asked for.  --- That doesn't mean that its going to happen exactly like that for you.  If they still just absolutely cannot afford to raise your pay to a place where you don't feel like leaving- then I'd offer to do your contracting outside of business hours and stack up money.

One important thing to consider is that if you left- you'd be replaced. It might be hard on them, but that's part of the territory of owning a business. You only get so many rotations around the sun- I wouldn't spend them wasted on woulda shoulda couldas."
,,Relevant-Avocado5200,,,,,"I would suggest that the potential benefits seem pretty decent in a pro/con way if everything is as it appears\*. 

It is entirely possible that you could work on a way of being kept at the new org (either in the same job or in another opening) if you fit in there and they like your work ethic while keeping your nice pay increase.

It may look good on future applications to help you get even better jobs in the future.  Learn some new skills to add to your resume, make contacts in the new org/field of work, use the pay as leverage in the future.

For some dumb reason, a vast amount of places require you to ""move out before you move up"" meaning that if you look they will usually hire someone from outside the org for higher positions instead of promoting from within.  Who knows, maybe after temp job you can come back to your current place and get a higher position and higher pay.  

If you get offered the job you could always see if your current boss has room to counter offer to keep you.  Obviously it is up to you how much it would take to keep you there vs going to the temp job.

Don't burn any bridges with either place and you may end up in a much better position to negotiate and/or have a ""fall back"" job/position.  

Be as forthcoming as you think is reasonable given your relationshipwith /personality of your boss.

\*My daughter has been looking for her first job out of high school and the amount of fake listings offering better than average pay for jobs that don't exist is really stupid high in our itty bitty county.   Is the listed pay in the average range of that job in other companies?"
,,snipergem,,,,,Noted. Thank you for your insights!
,,snipergem,,,,,"Thanks for your input! I can ask for a raise but I don't think they will be able to compete with 85k as my salary is currently 50k lol. Unfortunately thats just the nature of small businesses, the business itself is focused on keeping themselves a float during this recession."

Im just at a different place now, i want to keep growing and don't want to be somewhere because im comfortable. comfort doesn't align with growth. It's hard to ask for a raise when i'm close with the owner and can see how shes just trying to keep her head afloat right now, doesn't mean i won't though. If this new job doesn't line up for me, i 100% will be asking for a raise. Truthfully, i trust in God's timing and everything happens for a reason. I would be grateful either way :)"

I'm also an influencer and i'm working really hard on growing and making that full time. Truthfully, this corporate life is really just to pay the bills and get experience but personally, i don't see myself ""blue collared"" for a long time.

,,Foodie1989,,,,,"Longer hours and less money sounds like it sucks. Maybe you can accept the higher paying job now, if there's any room for growth or opportunities at all then take it and keep looking after a year or so... sounds like money is the main concern at the moment"
,,horribadperson,,,,,"Unless you absolutely love what you'll be doing to look past the less money and longer hours, take the money."
,,ByronTheBlack,,,,,Lmao. This was me a month ago. I had to decide between a job with growth vs a job with no growth but I make $20k more. Take the money then use your new position to try and find a better job.
,,dungorthb,,,,,I wouldn't invest in 'growth' at a company anymore. Get your money now.
,,FionaApplin,,,,,"When you say moving forward, do you mean this lower paying job would be better on a resume, or there is actual internal growth that could happen? Either way I would lean toward the higher paying role with better hours, as nothing is ever guaranteed, unless the other is a dream role that would open doors guaranteed that you wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise."
,,azscorpion,,,,,"If you are just starting out and can afford to, change jobs every 18 to 24 months to increase your pay. Once you find a good company and reach a level of pay/benefits you are comfortable with (knowing that you will be limited to 1% - 4% increases per year going forward), you can stop changing jobs. I recommend this to people that I lead as well, knowing that they may leave."
,,Bemmoth,,,,,"Depends on the job itself, the actual pay, and how bad the financial situation is.

However, 20k difference can be a big difference, but depends on the actual pay. 20k vs 40k, take the 40k. 100k vs 120k, I don't see a problem taking the 100k for the growth potential."
,,chewie8291,,,,,Take the money and less hours always.
,,teamrevenue,,,,,Take the money
,,DanielNoWrite,,,,,"This entirely depends on your life situation.

Always prioritize growth... unless you can't.

The real questions here are:

* How badly you *really* need that extra $20k?
* How real is the other job's growth potential?
* How early are you in your career? (ie. Younger you are, the more passing on growth potential will hurt you)

If you need that $20k, that's fine. Take it. Figure something else out later.

But the time you spend at a given job is an investment in your future. Always ask yourself what ROI you're getting. And know that it is very, very easy to waste years at a dead-end job, particularly if the pay is half-decent.

And know that the older you are, the harder it is to take low-pay-but-high-potential jobs."
,,whtabt2ndbreakfast,,,,,"Which one is more stable, more likely to keep you from being laid off a third time? Take that one, then reassess in a year or 18 months after you‚Äôve stabilized your life."
,,JoeyFreshH20,,,,,"I‚Äôd take the higher pay 9 times out of 10. Almost every job claims there is room to grow but nothing is guaranteed. Even if your good at your job and well liked, it still takes a fair amount of luck to get to where you want to be. Also, depends on the type of growth and your current salary. Is it title/compensation your seeking or experience and exposure? I‚Äôve seen a lot of friends and colleagues wait out growth opportunities and promises in the workplace that don‚Äôt amount to anything, myself included."
,,Evil_Goomba,,,,,"I think it depends on the role, your career path and what‚Äôs makes sense.

It‚Äôs very easy to say take the money, and most times I would agree but you need to take a longer term outlook to your career and weigh the pros and cons of the move.

You need to be honest with yourself and decide if your goals are realistic and if the next move gets you there. Corporate life is like chess - if you want to win you have to be smart and plan. 

Without details it‚Äôs hard to say which is better."
,,fuzynutznut,,,,,"I hate the terms ""potential for growth."" To me, it's a lure to keep stringing you along with empty promises of ""we'll look into your raise next month."" Or ""you just missed your goal, try hard and we will re-evaluate in 6 month."" I'd say move on to the money and always keep looking for more opportunities."
,,duderancherooni,,,,,Take the job that pays more. You can always hop to another job for your next pay bump or for a clearer career path later on.

,,Objective_String_793,,,,,Thanks so much. That‚Äôs how I feel exactly but having an mental battle on my future. Bills are piled high as hell rn
,,Objective_String_793,,,,,It‚Äôs true nothing is ever guaranteed and I was laid off from my dream role and another that I though had longevity. The higher paying role is for a successful high net worth individual vs a new startup organization with the lower pay
,,JoeyFreshH20,,,,,Agreed. 20k would make world of difference in quality of life if your currently on the lower end of the pay scale.
,,Objective_String_793,,,,,Omg this so much. I do feel like I‚Äôve heard potential for growth in so many different interviews
,,,,,,,Yeah I think this is good advice. Sometimes you need to put aside the longer view to bring the money in and establish yourself. If it's a good job in a good organisation it will open it's own doors and look good on your CV. I would say don't overthink it.
,,FionaApplin,,,,,"Have you worked for a startup before? Startups can be exhausting, and I have to say there is no way to guarantee longevity there. I of course can‚Äôt make that decision, but I have found as I get older, I choose financial security over the risk but that‚Äôs 100% personality. That said working for an individual has its own hurdles, speaking from experience and not knowing your relationship to the person. It is obviously more money but that can almost be less guaranteed if you do not have a solid understanding of the person. Again I speak not knowing the individual or industry. 

I was laid off about three months ago and just got another role so I may be more jaded, but I would pick the role you feel has more security given the current market if finding another role is difficult or time consuming in your field."

But i didnt want to be at thanksgiving dinner and have it thrown in my face that someone gave it to me...way too much pride not to earn it myself.

A few years later FedX bought Kinkos and every store manager was paid dividends based on the stores earnings... i would have received a check for about $9mil

,,JayGatsby8,,,,,"42 M. I‚Äôve been in hotels since I was 18. Took a few years off, but now I‚Äôm back. 

I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong in getting the job. What I will tell you is that life as a hotel manager isn‚Äôt easy. Numerous people have told me that they could walk into a property and be a manager on day one. NO CHANCE. It‚Äôs very demanding, and you really have to donate a lot of your life to doing it. And just like anything else, some hotels are very well run. And some aren‚Äôt. It all starts at the top (ownership).

That said, it‚Äôs quickly turned into an industry where it‚Äôs not what you know it‚Äôs who you know. I‚Äôm the worst at networking. I put my head down and work hard of course, and I do my job effectively. But I‚Äôm not there to make friends. We‚Äôll slowly but surely, people started leapfrogging over me. I spent four years working in corporate (at a major chain). I loved it there and I wanted to stay forever. I applied for promotions for which I was very qualified. Great interviews and so forth. Three times I was passed over in favor of young college grads - for positions that were far from entry level. Those people were tight with the recruiters, and were fast tracked. Unfortunately it‚Äôs an industry where people can either make or break you. And again, I‚Äôll put my head down and do my job all day. But I‚Äôm terrible at networking and meeting ‚Äúthe right people.‚Äù

Also, it‚Äôs an industry full of snakes. I mentioned I worked for a major chain, and I wanted to stay forever. That ended for numerous reasons, but paramount among them were I was accused of saying something incredibly offensive. And the fact is I never said it. I never even participated in the conversation where I supposedly made this comment. An anonymous complaint was filed, and they flat out didn‚Äôt believe me. Granted they paid me severance and unemployment, but I got walked out. I later found out the person who did that was a person I considered a friend. Someone with whom I had actually hung outside of work here and there. The industry is FULL OF SNAKES. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad, because the world needs hotel people also. But beware."

Kept saying I‚Äôm sorry but that I didn‚Äôt think she really cared for him or would care if I dated him since she was cat-fishing so many other dudes. She said she really loved him and they were still in contact to this day even which I knew. She‚Äôs gotten a lot of plastic surgery, lost lots of weight, and looks very different now.

,,bc1988britt,,,,,"You just basically said she‚Äôs a shifty person, stop caring what she thinks"
,,PM_Georgia_Okeefe,,,,,"You know you don‚Äôt have to engage with these people, right?"
,,Watsons-Butler,,,,,The only problem I see here is that *you care what terrible people think about you*.
,,UnknownTallGuy,,,,,I'm just responding to the very generic question in the title. The answer is for sure no in this case. I don't care about your cousin especially since they don't seem like a good person.
,,Ok_Huckleberry1027,,,,,Just quit talking to your family and tell the cousin to go fuck herself.  It's obvious which field you prefer.
,,soonerpgh,,,,,"The answer to all this is to ignore their toxic behavior and live your life. They are going to do and say all kinds of shit no matter what you do, so you may as well go on and be successful."
,,Saillux,,,,,They obviously don't give a fuck about how you feel so why do you care about their feels? Fuck em.
,,kapudos28,,,,,"No it doesn‚Äôt. Not at all. Do not allow other people to limit your success, ever. Yes that includes family. You will regret not living up to your potential for something as trivial as this. Shine bright."
,,utprosim16,,,,,"It sounds like you had a falling out with your cousin based on their actions, not the actual job. Your cousin gave you an opportunity and you did good. If you did bad, you probably would have still had a falling out because of that as well. I wouldn't blame the job/field because of the way a single person acted."
,,tracyinge,,,,,"No she's not the reason you're able to work in the field.  She gave you your start and you can thank her for that for the rest of your life if you want.  But the reason you're working and can continue working is that you're good at it, you took the ball and ran with it.  Keep running with it.  Maybe you will even end up being a good example for her and she will cut the crap and do a better job too."
,,Brooklynthicboi,,,,,Personally I wouldn‚Äôt screw someone over who helped me to obtain a position unless they did something malicious to me in the same workplace regardless if they helped me get into that position. If they helped you and haven‚Äôt done anything fucked up to you in the work place just chill and do your own thing and let them fuck it up.

Most friends too since I realized they are just like my fam. It really sucks. I‚Äôm looking for a therapist"

,,cherryglitter222,,,,,Thank you so much. I hadn‚Äôt thought of things this way it makes a lot of sense. I‚Äôm still nervous about what her & family might say but they probably do all just need to cut the crap how you say. I give them too much power over me.
,,cherryglitter222,,,,,"I‚Äôve explained a couple times how in the work place when it came time for my review with our boss she didn‚Äôt give me full credit for my work. She told the boss I wasn‚Äôt ready for a full time permanent position. They hired me to fill vacancies and get people to rent. It took me three months to fill every empty apartment through tours and just engaging with people the way she trained me and the way I learned to within all my hospitality jobs. They hired me cause it had been over a year and she couldn‚Äôt fill any of the empty apartments. I think maybe partly cause she had been busy using the empty apartments for dates and was involved with others within the company like the maintenance dude. She would purposely not show me how to use things like the fax machine and would just sit and watch me struggle to figure it out. She‚Äôs always been a bit malicious like this. I began to dread going to the job cause she would do a lot ‚Äúmean girl‚Äù stuff and since I wasn‚Äôt being given credit for my hard work I just stopped trying at the job too. I had already proved I could do the job and better than her but she hated this so I knew I wouldn‚Äôt ever be able to move up like that at this same company she was at so I stopped trying all together and quit. It was always supposed to be a temporary position anyways but our boss had been considering me for something permanent. They were very close I‚Äôm pretty sure he knew she was having sex with guys on the property and our co workers so I think she probably told him to not give me the full time permanent gig. I didn‚Äôt really screw her over cause I could have told the boss what she was using the empty apartments for even though he seemed to not care but instead I just told the guy she was dating at the time. He had been responding to almost everything I post on social media, sending me private messages. Some were not really flirtatious at all and he had become very close with my family, my brothers. So when I got ready to cut her off and take her off my social media I saw his convo in my DM‚Äôs, that he had been messaging me so much but I never once responded, I decided to reach out saying thanks for always being so kind to my family my bad for never opening your messages but now my cousin (that he was dating) and I do not get along I have to distance myself from you and others shes close with. I completely forgot why I argued with my cousin and how I left the job but it all stemmed from her disliking how I proved to do her job better. She blocked me and started messaging me through his account so that‚Äôs when I brought up that I could have ratted her out about using the vacancies for dates. That no wonder I completed the job in only 3 months cause she was busy with men. That she had the audacity to say I wasn‚Äôt ready for a full time permanent position and convinced her boss to not offer me the job. It looked like I was trying to rat her out to that dude she was dating but I wasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôd say she could imply I was screwing her over."
,,cherryglitter222,,,,,"What a cliche/bad joke. It‚Äôs just not funny & so played out. 

I‚Äôm really opening up & being vulnerable here."
,,tracyinge,,,,,"Just work, do a great job, move on.  If you make a big deal about the cousin thing then your family will to.  If you ignore the past and take care of yourself, nobody is gonna knock you for it.  If they do it's their problem, not yours.  

Your cousin probably wants to make you feel bad about the way things have turned out, don't let her have that power over you.  Do you."
,,RunningAmokAgain,,,,,"Yeah, definitely go for a therapist. If it seems like all/most of your family and all/most of your friends are messed up it's a good idea to take a minute to make sure it isn't you that's the messed up one."
,,Trashy_Pizza_Stealer,,,,,"Allow me to rephrase: she could have a Jerry Springer episode all to herself. Don't feel vulnerable. Don't regret your past. Take your blessings, say thank you for your present situation. keep improving. ! That said, sounds like that other person has never heard of ethics, so it may make sense to keep some social distance outside of work. I don't think you are a bad person, but your story is a tangled web of circumstances. however you aren't disqualified from deserving good fortune. Furthermore the fact that you engage in reflective exercises indicates maturity that many people never achieve. Lastly; just like you shouldn't take candy from strangers, don't pay attention to internet strangers opinions."
,,cherryglitter222,,,,,"I‚Äôm pretty self aware I just think there‚Äôs been generations of abuse, mental illness, & trauma within my family."
,,cherryglitter222,,,,,Thanks for clarifying & for your responses but some of what you‚Äôre saying is still offensive lol. Don‚Äôt tell people to not feel vulnerable. I‚Äôve definitely taken all of what you & others have been saying with a grain of salt. I do appreciate everyone‚Äôs input nonetheless. The other person you speak of is my cousin & we cut each other off after I quit the job. Since like I mentioned she just didn‚Äôt like that I did her job better than she did & took credit for all my work.
,,Trashy_Pizza_Stealer,,,,,Get over it. I don't care about your feelings and neither should any other stranger.
,,cherryglitter222,,,,,Lmao wtf is your problem? Why are you even spending your time/energy on my post if you don‚Äôt care? How about YOU get over it & get a life. You must be real miserable. What a weirdo.

,,Sqooky,,,,,"Look at it this way, it's about a $400 a month difference **before taxes**. If the $400 is going to make that big of a difference for you, go for it. Id personally go for the uncapped bonus. You've got the potential to earn a whole lot more."
,,GroundKarrots,,,,,I feel like this is a joke post. You're asking about 30-33k total compensation vs 50k+ ?
,,bombaten,,,,,Umm.. both base salaries are unlivable wages. Take the uncapped bonus.
,,eDisrturbseize,,,,,"In my opinion, if I was 24 and could afford to live off the lower base AND bet on myself for the larger bonuses- I would."
,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"Don't be afraid of change! I personally would chose the 26K base salary with potential for 24K in bonus because the bonus is based on you efforts. It sounds like the 3K bonus at your current job is to difficult to reach every quarter where in the new company everyone was been able to reach it.

In addition, any company that helps you with career growth and has opportunities within to grow is already a good prospect. Being stagnant at job/company can get draining and will not help you learn more and potentially get better jobs in the future. 

Always chose jobs where you are graded on your merits and where reaching the goals are realistic."
,,no_reddit_69420,,,,,Higher base salary. Bonuses can be taken away.
,,Lexy_d_acnh,,,,,The second option is definitely better. A 6k salary difference vs a 21k bonus is well.. a clear difference there haha
,,Kent556,,,,,"What‚Äôs meant by ‚Äú24k uncapped bonus?‚Äù Is $24k what is said to be typical, but there truly is no limit?

If so, seems like a no brainer here‚Ä¶"

I was warned that if I stayed at my company more than 8 years I would be a lifer.  Choose carefully looking at the long game."

,,McSmarfy,,,,,Tell me math isn't your strength without telling me math isn't your strength.
,,ArcadiaLeo,,,,,"In the uncapped bonus job, ask if everyone on your team was awarded the full bonus and/or if the bonus pay out is impacted by other targets/other team performances.  
My SO and I are both in bonus or uncapped commission jobs, but his job requires 3 layers of people to hit target before he gets his full bonus.    For example, last year he and his team were over their target by 12% but the other teams in his group (a global group with different projects) didn‚Äôt meet their targets.    His bonus was $6k less than the year before, because his payout was affected by the other teams dragging down the group performance.   It was a big bummer, since he expected (rightfully) a bigger bonus than the year before and bigger due to exceeding target. 
Commission and bonus opportunities can have big payouts, but the terms on which it‚Äôs paid out are very important to understand.

,,greenlightgaslight,,,,,I would choose neither. You can get a no experience sales role for more money than that
,,noodle-face,,,,,Normally I'd say choose the higher guaranteed salary but in this case the salary delta is small but the bonus delta is massive
,,Conscious-Sky-3139,,,,,I would be careful of a bonus because some companies make it damn near impossible to qualify for it.
,,GYAAARRRR,,,,,"Bonuses are taxed differently and (in your case higher) than the normal marginal tax rate (assuming USA). Not to say the 24k uncapped bonus is not the better choice but it‚Äôs something to consider. 

Also if you don‚Äôt hit your bonus qualifications the base pay is just $11.50/hr vs $14.40 assuming 40 hour weeks. 

Also also, showing a higher base pay may help with negotiating a higher wage at your next job. People generally don‚Äôt take pay cuts when they have more experience."
,,JamesM777,,,,,"I would go hi risk, hi reward and get that bonus money all day. Why?  Because you are 24 and now is the time to go for it."
,,ModeMore3375,,,,,Is that salary for the US?
,,BookNerd_4,,,,,Higher salary. Bonuses are taxed SO much more!!
,,Upper-Razzmatazz176,,,,,Go uncapped bonus. Seems likely you will at least get enough too match the 33k of the other job but most likely more. You got nothing to lose and I think you already know uncapped is the way to go
,,iamwondermommy,,,,,A local hospital just ripped away bonuses for good. I would NOT hedge on bonus.
,,Lunar_denizen,,,,,The bonus isn‚Äôt guaranteed
,,FitMight9183,,,,,I know... Rental prices for a flat 30m2 flat in my city are at the lowest 900 exl. per month expenses. So I live in a shared apartment in a 550 bedroom.
,,RaeVonn,,,,,This is my thought. Bonuses aren‚Äôt guaranteed. My SO was supposed to get a very large bonus late last year and didn‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt tell him until after payday that the company didn‚Äôt make enough profit for them to hit the bonus.
,,ok-broccoli404,,,,,"I would agree, but also point out that I'm 40 and REALLY love stability and predictability so I can pay the mortgage I already have.  A 24 year old without a mortgage (yet) can afford to gamble a bit.

I do not mean to imply doing what you love.  That choice is not available to most people.  My answer here comes from the implication that the jobs are the fungible

,,greenlightgaslight,,,,,If these numbers are accurate though a 4K annual base difference wouldn‚Äôt make sense for the lack of bonus. But regardless neither option is a good option

,,Zmannn36,,,,,"I've noticed this as well. I do contract labor hourly for a real estate company (basically patch up up cookie cutter houses as though they're apartments). The management doesn't have a single clue about maintenance work. They have guys trashing perfectly good appliances that just need a bit of patching up or some easy to fix part. Thousands of dollars fly out of the window a month. My first month there I was told to replace a water heater, I asked why and was told it was bypassed, no good and had to go. All that had been done was an overload switch tripped, not even being an electrician, I put my multimeter on the switch and saw it has continuity. It took about 10 minutes of research to discover the switch was fine, and suddenly I was some hero that saved the company thousands of dollars a month. Was this reflected on my check or more parts on the shelf? Of course not! Hell.. I didn't even get a dime of my ""sign-in bonus."" Decided it's time to put my experience into an actual trade once my wife figures out if she can transfer as easily to another base since she's a government sector employee in her position. Her year anniversary kicks in come May. I imagine your example of management applies in a different field, but it's all the same.

Did I make a good decision leaving the fire department for IT?,11l4vtc,ElectricOne55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/11l4vtc/did_i_make_a_good_decision_leaving_the_fire/,6,13,1678208762.0,
,,omgpickausername,,,,,"Seems like you miss your old job. But even if you were to go back, it wouldn't be the same probably. Can you perhaps be a volunteer firefighter and keep your paying job?"
,,SpecialCay87,,,,,"I left wildland and I interviewed for a job this past spring, a year into my hiatus.  Just taking about the job again in the interview made me not want to go back.  It was a fun six years, but making a career out of it would ruin it I think.  

Thought about municipal, but the bureaucracy and bullshit.  There is so much negativity and when times are slow it‚Äôs at it‚Äôs worst it seems.  The idle time brings out the worst in the ‚Äòheros‚Äô and being around them when they are bored is intolerable.  

I did a ride along with a municipal department in Sacramento when getting my emt.  Everybody knew to the day when they were retiring.  Whether it was five years out or 18 years.  I don‚Äôt want to be in an environment like that.  I‚Äôll do my property management job instead with a better career track.

I feel you though man. The temptation comes and goes, but the bs just wears on you.  Maybe someday I‚Äôll join a volunteer department. Probably a better fit for me and if drama strikes I can stand up from wherever I‚Äôm sitting and walk the fuck home and not care what the ‚Äòbros‚Äô think because I‚Äôm a volunteer and it‚Äôs on my terms at that point."
,,,,,,,"You switched to IT what?  IT is a very broad term are you a developer, Admin, network, etc? 

Only you can really answer your question, right vs wrong decision here is applicable to you and you alone.  For example...I personally wouldn't like the politics of being a fireman or cop.  I like an office where people aren't all up in my personal biz."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"IT is a wide range, depending where or with who you specifically work determines how close your coworkers are.  That may not be the best office for you long term.  But also I imagine when you‚Äôre a firefighter and saving lives and keeping each other alive things get more intimate in terms of knowing who each other is as people and trusting others with your life.  

But it sounds like maybe you miss the vibe, so why not also become avolunteer firefighter when you can?"
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"I think that was part of why I left too. At the end the newer people they hired had some attitudes and I didn't quite feel the same camaraderie with them. The whole making 40k thing seems tough tho. Plus all of the depts in my state pay around the same. So even if I left for another dept it would be similar. Unless it's a specialty like airport, hazmat, or Power plant firefighting. But, then your risking your body on the like even more lol."
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"Nice story bro.

Ya I left for IT and currently working at a university now. It's weird going from the fire department to working on a campus where for some people the college has literally been there only job for 20+ years and they haven't worked fast food or nothing else. And all the students are really uppity, have their parents pay their rent, and you can tell they haven't seen much or experienced life at all.

I'll tell some story about the fire dept and it'll be crickets, but if some other manager talks about some obscure IT policy or company software they act like that's the only thing in their life. I even had one coworker who just talks about taking pictures of her cats. Another that still builds Legos lol.

 I feel like half shit people do here would get then clowned the fuck out of if they were in the fire dept. That's part of what I don't miss in a way too, like if you made the smallest mistake in training or on a fire scene the department would never let it go and they'd zcall you out and say ""oh well you must not care about the citizens, oh you don't wanna show up 15 minutes early for work and stay late and talk with the crew, you must not care about the citizens lol""
And they'd cuss at you and ask you did something a certain way even over stupid shit lieke a way a station did house duties. Even though every station seemed to do things different.

Plus being the only one that works out in an office job kinda makes you feel some type of way too. Then you have the frumpy Karen's in HR, the old boomer workers that have their cliques in managment. The fire department could be almost worse with cliques though. Especially whenever you had to go to the training grounds or go to big battalion company meetings, it felt like high school cafeteria sometimes.

The idle time as you mentioned could be ruthless depending on the station though. Some stations would pull the whole you must not care about the citizens card if your not constantly looking at tools on the truck, reading an EMT book, or cleaning the fire station in your downtime. Other stations, we're more chill and they'd cut the lights off and watch movies or ballgames and it'd feel like the best time ever. But, like anything I think you only time to remember the good times and not the super strict stations with boomer captains that were calling you out if you couldn't remember every part of an SCBA. 

Even then sometimes the good times could be short cause you could be chilling and then get called for a structure fire where you'd be on scene all day. Sometimes just sitting down at work sometimes at my current job on a cold day though I still get that wringly feeling in my hands that you used to get after rolling hose back up at the end of a fire. Or very faintly smell the light smoke smell that was left when your doing salvage operations. You remember that smell? Or the loud noises of the truck starting up in the morning. I remember sometimes when we got a call the loud siren inside the truck used to fuck with me, and I was always sensitive to loud noises. 

Sometimes to this day idk how I passed CPAT or was able to keep my composure and do the 100 foot ladder climb test. I workout at least 3 times a week and have always been consistent, but the CPAT was super humbling the stair climber, tunnel crawl, and the pike pole test at the end killed me. I barely had enough energy to raise my arms up at the end. It always confused me how they made us do all that shit, yet when you get in the company you have battalion chiefs that are 300 lbs and shit lol.

But, ya do any of these things ring a bell and if so what do you think, does it bring bacj mostly good or bad memories?"
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"Ya the people in fire dept would ask very personal shit like are you married, what church you go to, among other things. 
The office environment is weird though it's like people only talk about the job and that's it.

I work in system/cloud admin. I have a ccna but could never find a networking job."
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"I thought of that too good suggestion, not sure how I'd fit it into my schedule. Or if I'd need to recertify my ff or EMT certs?"
,,omgpickausername,,,,,"Seems like you did not make a wrong decision by leaving. Perhaps that specific job you have today is just not the perfect fit. Right now is not the best time to look for a new job. But it doesn't mean that you will stay there forever. This is just a stepping stone. Maybe a smaller mission-based company in the future. Think of this time as school, which you are paid for. Take everything in, and prepare yourself for the next role."
,,SpecialCay87,,,,,"Sometimes it‚Äôs just time to hang it up before you dilute the good memories with too many bad ones.  I have a lot of good memories, but towards the end  I wasn‚Äôt enjoying the most important part of the job: the suppression.  And that‚Äôs a problem.  

I think it would be fun to work at a volunteer station.  Keep quiet about my past experience and when people find out that I was a wildland firefighter, great.  My first time as a volunteer (before my six years in wildland) I just tried to keep my mouth shut and sit in the back of the room and take from it what I wanted to take from it.  I didn‚Äôt try to stand out or be better than anybody else and if I did it again I would do the same.  I don‚Äôt want to square off against Dwight Shrute types at the volunteer fire department, not why I would be there. I feel at peace with it knowing I will probably get back to being a volunteer someday.  In a situation that is more on my terms.

And yes I remember that smell, you never forget it.  Pulled out an old raincoat I would use on assignment, that I kept in my pack.  It smells of burning pine trees.  I went up to a co-worker at my current job and told them to smell it.  They smelt it and looked at me in disgust like ‚Äòwhat the hell that‚Äôs gross.‚Äô  I just smiled.  They don‚Äôt get it.  You get it, I get it.  And that‚Äôs really all that matters moving forward is that we smile in those situations because most of the memories associated with those momentary reminders are good ones."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"I‚Äôm guessing that would be jurisdiction specific.  That said, doesn‚Äôt have to be today, but something to look into."
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"I agree that the economy seems really bad.
I applied for 100 jobs and got 2 interviews.
But, I'll get like 5 recruiters that message me a week but it's often for 6 month contract to hire roles, roles that pay similar, or higher paying roles that seem like they have no work life balance and want 25% travel time."
,,ElectricOne55,,,,,"I feel bad cause I couldn't keep my gear. The only thing I could was my back bame plate from my fire coat :(. Do you think that really matters tho or am I just overreacting.

And ya the Dwight Shrute types. I tended to sit back too because in every job I've had even fast food lol there would be some people that acted like their job was their life and they'd know all these stupid details like they have nothing better to do."

It's a termination of the business relationship regardless of how you look at it, just one of the parties feels entitled to ""professional courtesy"" while rarely extending any courtesy to the opposite party. 

Companies no longer deserve employee loyalty. I will argue at one point, they did, you know, when they respected their workers. Now, employers require 5 years of experience and a masters degree for entry level positions, and use computer generated algorithms to reject workers before they ever get a chance to see a person from the company. 

If I have to jump through enormous hoops to get hired, then the employer should at a minimum step over a hoop on the ground to expect any loyalty in return.

,,,,,,,"Ok, so I'm in HR so kinda know the data side of this. 

Hiring managers generally have no idea how many roles you're applying for. However, the recruitment team does.

If it's a large (over 5k employees) company, they may not even notice. Each department will have its own dedicated recruitment team and they may not communicate well, even if using the same technology. They're incentivesed to not to. 

If it's a smaller company, you might get dismissed by the screening recruiter / sourcer / HRBP, due to multiple applications.

I would say, it depends on the company.

If it's a small new company, they probably didn't invest in expensive ATS, so they may not notice.
If it's a mid-size or tech company, they probably notice. It doesn't necessarily look bad, but you're not going to be able to negotiate effectively, as they know you're desperate.
If it's a larger but newer company, you're probably going to fall through the cracks and none notice it until you get to at least one interview. 
If it's a large and older, established company, they're going to have a sophisticated and very strict system, and will filter you out before you even reach the recruitment team."

,,IncoherentPenguin,,,,,"Working in retail means your already have a leg up on most IT staff as you‚Äôre able to communicate with the general public.

It took me twenty years to get used to public speaking etc to leave the dev world behind. So, IT might be a decent career path for you but honestly why limit it to IT or banking. Do both. Here in Canada Scotiabank has an amazing dev shop. They actually started a whole new company for it, as I recall. It‚Äôs the front runner in terms of IT banking opportunities. That said CIBC and Royal are always looking for decent programmers. BMO is also doubling down on the whole artificial intelligence thing, long story short, IT will always be a good way to go."

Once you've identified that career path, then figure out what certifications you might need to help you get there."

It's nice to know you are looking into mentorship. Mentoring allows people to learn from one another, providing a path to knowledge transfer. In the workplace, for instance, someone established in their career can share knowledge and insights, as well as offer guidance, to someone with less experience. 

Whereas it's hard to find the right mentor, there're a lot of ways you can find the right mentor for you. We at Maven Career Coaching provides mentorship to students and career aspirants, you can surely take a look!

The not eating at the desk policy, I can see if there was a problem with it being messy. I'm a eat at my desk by myself kind of person, so I'd be frustrated if I had to eat elsewhere. If there is a vermin problem because people are messy, that would be reason enough to find a new company since they don't clean their offices and I don't want to work with mice at my feet.  

Does OPs manager not expect people to drink coffee at work? Are the employees allowed coffee breaks? or breaks to refuel with caffeine? it takes me longer than 15 minutes to drink a cup of coffee. 

Personally, I'd ask around about why this is a policy. I would also just eat my desk and when I got reprimanded for it, I'd ask questions about why it is a policy to begin with and explain why I do it. Maybe ask for a policy change."

The OPs managers are really understanding, they both eat/drink at their desks because they never get a chance to have a proper break (and one of them is 7 months pregnant and she is not allowed to eat anything at her desk now either!) It's just the business manager!

When I was working in my last role at this company (I'm about to turn 29 and I am in my fifth year here), I did Uber nights and weekends to help pay for my wedding. I was in a sales role but there was no commission and my bonus was capped at 10% of salary, so as long as I was answering emails and doing my job, there wasn't much to do during nights and weekends. My direct boss knew, and eventually other people found out. Only one VP took issue with it, he called it disloyal but half in jest. I knew he didn't like it, but he doesn't like anything. Eventually, I got promoted to my current role with variable comp. I make commission and a tiered bonus, so there is no point in moonlighting.

They might‚Äôve said something that a manager didn‚Äôt like or they just weren‚Äôt sociable enough and people forgot about them. It was without warning to them that a primary source of income for them was just taken away. For the latter reason I did develop some metrics to help prevent forgetfulness as well as bringing it up myself.

At this place of business they also tried to manage full timers out by being as toxic towards them as possible.

,,3ddisun,,,,,"This.

I used to work for this revolting consulting firm for a few years, the majority of time I spent working there was good. I slowly made my way up the tiers of management starting from the lowest point. Mostly because my friend who was in management, got me the job and It was rather easy to get info on new upcoming promotions and whatnot. 

When I made it to floor manager, it was great we all got a group of agents who, in their own right, would dance circles with the amount of knowledge they had. I, as their manager, considered myself blessed due to the fact that 'Yo, my team was stacked!'. 

Along came a friendly competition between sites, the project was split by many sites in different cities all that had to maintain a completed and resolved percentage of 80 or higher. My agents, I can proudly say, finished with an approval of 92%.

  
The month was done, we finished our third quarter, our heads held high. I consulted with my team and decided to take my one week vacation.  It was great. Went to Cancun, while on my last day I get an email from one of my agents saying that they would like to speak to me when I return and didn't want to mention anything further to not disrupt my vacation. I appreciated the sentiment, I figured, 'ah geez, what now' assuming it was something minor.

I get back to the office and check my emails. Normally after vacation It was custom to go through a hundred or so emails of just random meetings you haven't attended due to the vacation, people asking for time off, etc. Instead of the norm, I notice close to 500+ emails. Conversations. Images. 

What was happening  was, as I pieced everything together, our site was going through a mass firing. See, all the agents were part of a contract hiring process so notice didn't need to be given if it was proven that they were not abiding by said contract. 

The majority of agents that were fired had accents. Literally, the only thing I can logically think of why all of these people were let go.

(Rewind) Before this month-long contest that we held was discussed, there was a rumor that our site had hired ""non-English"" speaking agents and our project manager was getting heat from an exclusive client. 

As I read the email, I read stories of how people were escorted out by security with their belongings in plastic grocery bags, boxes, or just in hand. I read about how an agent defecated all over the entrance door yelling, people would arrive to work to have their card not scan and open the door. Instead they were greeted by security with a letter of termination. I read about how an engineer on my team, because of his ""accent"" was fired not for his computing abilities, rather his ability to say ""Windows Vista properly"".

To this day, I remember the last coffee I had with T.A. You were right brother.

Although what I say next may not directly apply to you, please consider it.

""my direct report had a nervous breakdown during my first week, I‚Äôve had zero support dealing with this""
- it's your direct report, doesn't matter when you started. What are you doing as a leader to support this person? I guess with sensitive issues you may need help, maybe from HR, but i wouldn't think your subordinate wants the whole org to know about the breakdown. Have you investigated the cause of the breakdown? What's your action plan or development plan for this employee? Being in leadership role, you have a huge opportunity to change the culture, even if it is just for your team. 


""toxic culture: two factions who hate each other and pressure me to take their side in meetings, people trying to trick you or show you up to advantage themselves""
You don't need to pick a side. I'm more than sure the while organization isn't split in 2 sides. Sounds a little weird, but show your above and beyond that drama, bring those around you to why you're all there, the mission and values of the organization. You will come off wiser than the people playing petty games. Be authentic you can gain trust, promote a positive atmosphere and gain the support of those around you. Only puts you in a better position for the future.


""extreme overwork- I‚Äôm doing my job and nervous-breakdown-girl‚Äôs job, no move from management to find more resource.""
You said she had her breakdown during your first week which was before Christmas. As her leader have you still not yet created that action and development plan for her? I'd think that's a you issue. Before you got there the org and processes were running. Don't see now why they'd need to hire more people. 


 ""Set up to fail. Impossible deadlines, can‚Äôt get anything cleared through management, means I end up having to put pressure on other teams, who get upset/angry.""
Not clear why if management doesn't clear you put pressure on other teams. Is there more than one way to get things cleared? All I'm seeing here is a huge opportunity to create process efficiency. A fat project with your name all over it, seize it!


""this week, someone died unexpectedly in an adjacent team. My boss still hasn‚Äôt cleared their work so I had to go to the meeting and tell my bereaved colleagues that sorry, we‚Äôve made them miss all their deadlines, we know it makes their lives much harder but we‚Äôll try better next time.""
That's sad, sorry for the loss. People tend to get frazzled when a regular process gets disrupted. Have you expressed the concern and impacts of what happened with your boss? Looks like a learning opportunity to me. Although a rare occasion for the future, still an opportunity to learn and come out on top with your team.


 ""not respecting my rights as a disabled person. My supportive tech isn‚Äôt working that well on their IT systems + constant urgent deadlines = broken body.""
This is the only thing that I've read that's really out of your control. Have you connected with IT? Are they actively doing anything to help you? Have you tried communicating your concerns with HR? I am interpreting this that technology isn't compatible - they could be working on a solution, if they're not that's when you should take it up the ranks.

RE: what am I doing to support my direct report? Have put in approx an hour a day since I started in December to listening and supporting and understanding her needs and co-creating a plan. Initiated HR and occupational health processes. Escalated the issues that tipped her over the edge to senior management and suggested a range of ideas to remedy the situation. Zoomed her at 5pm everyday to get her to stop working. The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back? A 5pm email from senior colleague saying that my manager has agreed that my direct report and I will complete a complex piece of analysis and present at a meeting at 10am the next day. We had no forewarning of this. I told her to log off and let me push back but she was inconsolable, saw it as a sign that nothing was going to change. There‚Äôs only so much one person can do. Also, I asked direct report for feedback on how I handled the situation so that I could learn, and she said that I‚Äôve given her more support in one month than she‚Äôs received from everyone else combined for the year preceding my arrival.

I know it was a rhetorical question you asked to prompt me to reframe things, I just felt the need to clarify a bit!"

As well, organized people are in short supply in most companies.  You would probably advance quickly.

Also, have you considered what would happen if you simply stopped working every day after 9 hours?  Just leave at the same designated hour every day.  You would be more rested and more productive.  What would happen?  I seriously doubt you'd be fired.  You are too valuable.

I would simply state that the verbal agreement and your mail were clear, that you were eager to join the company, and ask if they would consider revising as per your initial agreement.

If the amount is lower but it's not the one you signed up for, the first thing you need to do is to ask if there is an honest mistake. If the answer is no you should start evaluating the options:

\- Keep working there for a lower salary while looking for a new job

\- Leaving the job immediately to keep your sanity

\- Report this to any governing body that can at least look into it.

Have you thought about, or would you consider consulting (independently) in your field? Consultants are always in demand. It would give you a familiar feeling of being in waters you already know while making sure you are not personally involved in the daily implementation (should give you time off to relax; sorry about the burnout). Consultation could also broaden your mind and opportunities as you have more time to explore or try new waters.  Anyway, since merely mentioning how consulting or any career change/ growth would look like may seem a bit hazy, maybe [this video](https://youtu.be/0PswlEk2Pmg) might show you the steps; kind of Strategic Planning that allows you visualize your bigger goals and work your plan until you have specific steps you can start implementing."

The video I shared with you should help you know visalize ever single aspect (especally by the time you get to step 4) so that you know exactly what needs to be done and when.

On a different note, don't immediately quit what you are doing or jump into consultancy (expecting outright smooth flow of things). You can start laying te foundation(maybe looking at potential clients, research a bit on an extra service you can provide them, rates that other consultants in your field charge, etc. In 1. (starting small-time consultancy - could even be free -) you still have the security of your job but are trying out consultancy with the pressure to succeed quickly. With 2.

They do train but COVID is making them hold off on classes and therefore holding me back. You need these classes and at least 2 years experience before you can be certified, so before you can make decent money. With me starting with no prior experience I make shit money that barely covers COL. 

Our main mechanic went to formal school while you and does most of the other work, it seems that now a days you have two main choices to get in to many trades. 
Option 1, get lucky and find a place that will hire you with no experience and train you, but barely pay you enough to live. 
Option 2 is go to school, probably take on debt, and then you can work and make decent money.

You can't really start as a teen formally (like at a shop or school) until you graduate high school  and turn 18 due to child labor laws. You can informally start if you begin your interest with a trade and do it as a hobby, and might be able to find a place to pay you under the table or if you work for family. Some places will you that for summer work, but again you'll get abismal pay due to no certifications.

How do I indicate my position on a resume if I stepped down from a leadership role?,iohsq0,taymarie6793,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/iohsq0/how_do_i_indicate_my_position_on_a_resume_if_i/,8,3,1599518319.0,
,,pjson18,,,,,"It definitely is worth mentioning, you can do a similar style to linkedin that you break down the different positions within a company by year. So 2010-2013 first position, 2013-2016 second position and 2016-current third position. 

If you have corresponding breakdown in linkedin, yoh can do a description for each position. Good luck!"
,,AGKCareers,,,,,"I think you should definitely include your leadership experience in your resume. Spend more time highlighting your accomplishments, strength or awards that supports your successful performance in the role.  If you've had for example 3 different roles, you can just list the job titles and collapse the key achievements relating to your time with that company.

If it comes up in an interview, just be honest and share your reasons  for stepping down - School , work/life balance.  Any company that value self development and work/life balance will certainly see eye to eye with you.

All the best with your studies and career!"

Visibility?,ilbh6e,J909090,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ilbh6e/visibility/,7,2,1599068395.0,
,,,,,,,"I'm an amateur at this, probably (high school student), but I can try to give advice. To become visible would probably mean that you should mask yourself in a certain **set** of habit**s**. I'd classify this in the categories of communication, labour, and integrity. They are kinda things that bite off each other to give more importance to one another.

1. Communication comes in forms of either significance and attentiveness. 

a. Significance is how important your communication is, from saying ""Hi!"" to a worker (or simply bowing your head a little \[use eye contact {if too much of a nuisance, just look at their hair instead of their eyes}\]) once every three times you pass them, all the way to saying, ""can I help you?"" or anything that gives the vibe that you are an extrovert that contains all your energy for specific, precise helpfulness. All of this, if you try to do it, will make people think that you have the willingness to humble your strength for other's benefits. It's easy to pay attention to.

b. Attentiveness is the extent in which you try to create attention, speaking of, but in a pretty self-conscious way. Put it like this; why do you nod/bow your head a little when you greet people? It's to show that you are attentive enough for them that you give them energy, even if they think you view them as mere strangers. Things like these that are viewed as sub-conscious (meaning done by things \[like muscle-memory\] automatically) help you look like an active human being. Add this to the significance part of your communication. When you, say, ask for people's attention, you act ""extra,"" so that you may be noticed as a tireless piece of machine (harsh way to put it but try to humble yourself). Things like indirect communication involving stretches and yawns should be specifically made to look like it has something to do with your work; say, you stretch your arms upwards and after that place your hands on your computer with eye contact directed at it; people will view the significance of it.

Small note:

Okay, so let me get this straight; **this is exhausting (or I'd think it somewhat is)**. Good news is, that's why privacy exists, for introverts and extroverts. Put off all those faces when you're alone, and sleep on bed, while you kinda' contemplate your strategy of this for your next day of work. **Warning: I would not suggest for you to ever, unless necessary (perhaps you would be able to tell when), tell your workers the way you had all these strategies planned out (most especially for the reason of pride, like, y'know, boasting, or desperately having an attitude of ""I've done all of this and this is how you repay me?!""). People won't forget that you are a hard-machine worker, but they will hate your selfishness and PRIDE. If you think it's not worth it to work this hard without telling other people, that's another problem with your philosophy of life (the fear of having wasted your strength for nothing).** 

Moving on...

2. Labour: This part is more related to your issues regarding yourself. Remember that note? Keep all of the hard-working part consistent. No, don't stop working, don't. Eat lunch just enough, and whether or not you actually did, drain all your energy to work hard by yourself; this keeps you from dozing off. The reason this is significant is for the reason that people have too see the way you can confirm that you are that person who gave an example of a good worker, visibly, in the initial impression by communication. Leave smaller times in between breaks, especially stretches, and go do stuff; if you are finished with your assignment or tasks, ask for future assignments or more regarding the same previous topic. ASK, ASK, ASK (try reading your boss' and workers' expectations; if they see your sweating, tired self now, would they think you've shown yourself already as an energetically wasted man in work for the time being, or not?). Ah, also, if you are sleep deprived, try coffee (don't use it at break time unless you have important things to do). If you show that you are capable and all that, the labor and results from it may be the best evidence to support how you are a visibly strong worker.

3. Integrity: In the previous small note, I told you to keep it in your heart, right? The ideology behind this integrity is to do things even when people are not watching. You're humble to the rule. If people scold you at your work time after you read this, ignore that and be humble. In other words, drill it to other people without even noticing it yourself, what kind of a person you are, besides doing it purposely. You continue your habit of getting right on track, while sometimes getting to show other people openly that you are working (though focus a lot on your work alone anyways compared to showing off your communication). Standing up straight while working (at least once every 8-20 minutes can increase your attention from other people by a certain amount. Although, if you could, start doing these positively in a subconscious manner, as if, you don't do this for the purpose of doing it. Say, why do people love the colour yellow? Say, perhaps it's generally because it reminds them of a radiated form of light, because of how it generally doesn't have a noticeable identity of having a dark form of its hue; brown and gold isn't called dark yellow a lot, right (I think this is the case)? Because of lacking saturation, yellow is liked for its simplicity and attentive brightness. Now, why do you choose to stand upright? It's because the boss told you, but from that you also add that you genuinely respect him for giving you financial support and wish to help other people you respect too. Or perhaps you never had this thought of respect? Why do you choose to use hairgel and swirl it to the left side? Because it's not distracting, compared to swirling it to some other sides, or that it doesn't block your ear from being visible to other people so that they can have confidence in hearing you, and to have all these things fulfilled, you scarified your strength to take some minutes to help other people (even if your heart did not desire this). If people misunderstand you in a positive, negative, awkward, whatever light, you can try to correct them (so that your relationship with other workers are not awkward). Then again, I think you'd better keep it to yourself, unless someone directly asks why you do it; whether or not you want to be honest, please be kind (this is also a form of effort, seen from humility).

&#x200B;

To give you some context: I'm not the most credible; I mean, I'm not a top scorer student in anything much and I can get lazy sometimes as a student (in addition it's like 5 am in the morning right now for me); I'd like for you to assess and only take what is necessary from this, and hope that you may do well. Sorry to trouble you if this mini essay is too much.

This last message may not mean a lot to you by chance, but God bless."
,,killing-me-hardly,,,,,"      I think the above is great advice, and you offer insights well beyond your years. I would like to add a quick anecdote to stress the importance of  ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù. 
      When I got my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù job, the one I would build my career on....I thought keeping my head down and focused on the job at hand was enough to succeed. I had received excellent reviews. One comment suggested I enter a management training course, which I took ASAP . Soon after the training course, my manager left, and implied that I would be taking over his position, but in reality, I was passed over for someone outside the department. The word ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù was never used. I was told I was ‚Äúoff their radar‚Äù, but now that my ambitions were known it would help to ‚Äústay on the radar‚Äù. 
        From then on, I made sure to disengage from my actual work, just to be seen around the office. Frankly,  I was less productive, but I would say visibility is extremely important for your career progression. I‚Äôve been an operations director now for over 10 years (and in management for almost 20), and I spend at least 30% of my week in upper lever conversations, and maybe only 20% with my managers. It‚Äôs a great way to get desirable projects and stay in the front of the mind of those that would promote you. Whoever said you need visibility may see something in you, and want to see more. 
        If you‚Äôre an introvert, you‚Äôll have to push that down, talk shop with your manager as often as you reasonably can....make sure the conversations aren‚Äôt always about having a problem that needs to be solved. Be visible, be the best at what you do, and you‚Äôll get noticed."

,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"Coffee and I focus on small objectives.

Ive been doing office work for 6+ years now. You have to break it down or you want to turn into an oncoming truck on the way to work. Office work doesnt offer the chemical release that physical labor does. When you sweat or on your feet, you feel like you did things. When you work in MS office, you mostly feel silly. Gotta set small objectives and find your way to take advantage of whatever situation your in.

Also, if you feel it I guarantee you everyone else does. What difers is reaction."
,,DrJonTam,,,,,"Hey, no worries. No one's going to berate you about privilege and stuff. These are tough times for everyone and we are all fighting our own battles.

Regarding motivation, intrinsic motivation comes from three sources:

1. Competence - you're good at what you do and it's intrinsically satisfying
2. Autonomy - freedom to do what you want to do
3. Relatedness - a community of people to do it with you 

Clearly you're missing out on the community piece with COVID. But how about the first two? Are you good at the skills for your job and do you derive satisfaction doing it? Do you feel the freedom to do what you want to do?

Extrinsic motivation is just the carrot and stick approach. If you're meeting ends meet, psychology shows anything more than $70k isn't going to make you any more motivated.

Another thing it sounds like you're struggling with working from home in general. I have a video about overcoming WFH struggles [here](https://youtu.be/elLhIN5bnS4).

,,ShirtlessChampion,,,,,"I work in an office job and find that rewarding myself throughout the day helps me to focus. Break the day up into multiple different chunks and it feels a heck of a lot shorter. Usually everyday I: 

- Make coffee after answering some morning e-mails 
- Take a short (5-10 min) walk prior to eating lunch and getting back to work 
- Take a reddit or social media break in the afternoon 
- Wrap up at least a portion of the project I'm working on before logging off at the end of the day. Makes you feel good about your day."

,,DrJonTam,,,,,"I help people gain career clarity for my work and at your age, this is really a common question that many people share. So don't worry, you're totally normal.

The best thing to do if you're not sure is to experiment and get a taste for different lines of work so you gain a deeper self-awareness of who you are, what the workforce is like, and how it's like to work with a range of personalities, cultures, and backgrounds.

Through this process, try to figure out your interest, skills, lifestyle preferences, values, and personality on top of the market trends in fields that pique your interest. Luck will play a factor too, the community you're in will matter a lot (especially if you end up in a toxic situation or meet a great mentor).

Of all of the above, your personality is probably the most important since that determines the nature of the work that you'll be doing. Even when companies hire for entry-level positions, they hire first for ""fit"" (personality, can you get along with everyone else), then ""skill"" (can you do it), then ""experience"" (have you done it before) - usually in that order. 

Personality also largely affects what kind of jobs are suited for you. For example, if you're really introverted, you'll be hard-pressed in a sales role that requires constant socializing.

,,JustJess234,,,,,"My library job lasted five years, counting the two and a half I volunteered in college. It was diverse, positive environment.

The coworkers were ok, my bosses were ok, the bosses behind the bosses were difficult to get along with at times and I could feel a little competitive sometimes, but mostly everyone got along and supported each other. A supportive environment with room to move up in the workplace would be the best work environment.

,,jack_bag,,,,,"Boundaries are crucial. You have been robbed of the normal physical boundary now, so you have to somehow construct your own. All while a random remote boss and team are expecting things, not honoring the boundaries (because, guess what, they don‚Äôt really exist any more). This is an impossible task, and a big big drawback of working from home. Not to even mention the multiplying dynamics of needing to fit in with a team - now remotely. 

Set boundaries. Have time at work and time away from work. (This means phone down, email off). If you have a good boss - set a 30 minute meeting to discuss this, he/she will very likely understand as they are going through the same. Except, respect that they are under greater pressure than you to get things done, now with a team they can‚Äôt soft-monitor and see how everyone‚Äôs doing. 

Be proactive - reach out to people, introduce yourself, have weekly or bi-weekly catch ups, get good at talking about things not work related and building relationships in the distance - this will be a key part of helping you fit in, and getting the info of what‚Äôs going on, the struggles others are dealing with, and how you can help out more effectively.

For some outgoing social people, cruising around the office talking it up is normal - they benefit from this a lot, given it‚Äôs not too much. Many other people aren‚Äôt that social, don‚Äôt really want to be at work, and keep to themselves. Relatively, they don‚Äôt get the benefit of fitting in that well. It would be to their benefit to push their comfort zone and go socialize once in a while. A new person in this situation doesn‚Äôt even know how to begin socializing until after several team meetings, etc. But now, you make all those people work from home, multiplying the problem - making it even harder for people to connect. Be proactive, it‚Äôs the only way you will build the social comfort you need to then be able to tell people hey, sorry, I am not available at the moment. As the new one, you have the ability to set an intro meeting, or share your concern in a quiet way- but don‚Äôt be neurotic about it, just mention it to those you feel some degree of trust with. Being new, ESPECIALLY during times of change (such as guess what, the pandemic) means new folks can sit without adequate work for some time, or without adequate understanding of what they need to do or how. This is normal. Remember that most other people are glad to have someone on board to fill a gap that someone else left - so do the best you can to identify this and jump in and help out smiling. 

The stress of this is huge, but attack it daily, or suffer the huge and demanding consequences. I‚Äôve been there, and it‚Äôs entirely unsustainable if you want to keep both your family and your job. Good luck, it‚Äôs tough, but doubly tough for introverts. It is surmountable with sustained effort though, and you will make it through."
,,gracenuleep,,,,,"I second that setting boundaries is key especially during these times. If you're still relatively new to the company, take some time to understand the new company culture and how others at the company are navigating remote work. The pains + benefits of remote work are felt by everyone right now so you may find that you can even connect on common pain points. It's also hard to disconnect when new to a company but I think it's important to also take care of yourself. They hired you because you were skilled and experienced. Your skills and experience don't change at a new company. You may be learning new platforms, software, and organization styles but you bring your experience and knowledge to the table."

,,momboss79,,,,,"I was once told by the ‚Äòmean‚Äô girl in my office when I was pregnant with my youngest, that pregnancy was a choice and that she didn‚Äôt want to ever hear me complain about being pregnant. And she didn‚Äôt. I never said a word. Later on when said mean girl had a really awful pregnancy which had her on bed rest for about 4 months, she ‚Äòbragged‚Äô to some colleagues how I had such a great pregnancy and that I never complained about being pregnant. And I flat out told her in front of everyone that I didn‚Äôt complain because she had threatened me and that this was her Karma. (That was petty but at that point she had bullied me for too many years). 

We used to have the same office shit that everyone has. Gossip, rumors, back stabbing, Sabotage of projects. I‚Äôm the manager now and none of those drama queens work for me anymore. I don‚Äôt allow bad behaviors, no rumors, no gossip and my team knows I‚Äôm serious. I had to use someone as an example in order to get it through to them. They all have aged at this point (over the last 15 years) and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because they are just mature now or if they just got tired of it, but there isn‚Äôt any drama in my office. It also helped that the manager was let go as well because she was the original ring leader. They cut it off at the head. 
I stayed in a toxic environment because I felt like I had to. I needed the job and I needed the benefits so I never had the courage to leave. Many before me though, did leave and eventually, upper management figured it out and reorganized. I have a really good team and they all work very well together.

It doesn't much matter the area but it can be helpful to have someone closer to you who may know of more direct opportunities that aren't the opportunities you are seeing. 

That's not what I do usually, I just help people figure out their dream jobs name and give some steps to getting to it, I insert backbones and hope quite a bit in the process, delete imposter syndrome, etc.

,,upquark00,,,,,"What exactly is it about medicine that you don't like?

If it helps to hear someone else's story: I wanted to go to medical school and practice psychiatry. I shadowed doctors and worked in an ER and volunteered in a different ER and took a lot of the classes you would need. Then discovered that I don't like bodily fluids and the possibility that I might get an accidental needle stick freaked me out. Saw some gnarly things in a trauma center too.


I also realized that medicine is intricate and fascinating but doesn't answer the types of *questions* I'm actually *interested* in in life. For example, treating someone's diabetes engages problem solving skills and requires compassion, but it doesn't exactly help understand the nature of reality or shed light on consciousness or perception (all topics I AM intensely fascinated by).

So with this in mind I decided to go back and become an AI engineer. My degree was somewhat related so that made it easier, but you could definitely go back and take some community college courses - even while working - I highly recommend it. There are lots of free intro courses online that could help you start poking around and finding those topics that stimulate you. I've been teaching myself to code for about 4 years, off and on. No need to jump ship on your old job yet.

And perhaps you don't care about metaphysics? Maybe you just want something relaxing or physically satisfying, like teaching or carpentry or dog training? After the pandemic you could certainly try volunteering.

And let me tell you also as someone who made a drastic career/field change: yes, it's gonna require you to work your butt off. No getting around that. If you want the easy switch, then you'll end up answering phones, like you said.

Better question: How much would you pay to find your dream? How much would you pay to invest in yourself, too? Many invest $50,000 for a bachelors degree....and consider the cost to not have been worth it. 

Comparatively, $4000 seems like a tiny drop, which is the low end of what high ticket consultants charge. (Not every career consultant is high ticket. Some are mid, and their prices vary too much for me to say.)

 I don't work with mid/ high ticket clients, though. I charge $499, and you'll get a course, and 3 chats with me to kick your butt towards your dream job!"

,,Expertrons,,,,,"Hey,

Dreaming of a career is easy, but actually working on it is a tedious task. First, you need to know what you want. Many dreams can literally create chaos in your mind.

Following certain steps can help you with it

1. Braindump your love for doing something and focus on it to have a specific career path.
2. Then you need to shortlist which career path will help you to go closer to your goals.
3. Look for some certifications, internships to get hands-on experience and ideas on how the work is going to be in that domain.
4. Stay confident, and not worry about being perfect.

Hope this helps :)"

The assessment typically includes the assessment of interests, personality, aptitude / ability and work values. 

Psychometric tests are designed specifically to measure your suitability to careers and this evaluation may or may not include an aptitude test. Psychometric tests which measure your suitability to careers are more commonly referred as career assessments or career tests.

,,rsdbqb19,,,,,"I went with experimenting with what works best with me rather than choosing what to do. I took whatever was available at each time. It wasn't very efficient money-wise, but I honestly couldn't think of a better way to learn more skills and develop professionally.

I did a very basic executive simple job as I was graduating college, in a very small firm with barely any people. I then switched to teaching language for adults and spent a little more than 3 years doing it but in like 4 different schools ( mostly course-based and only once teaching for 2 semesters in a university).

I've also been a cultural facilitator, translator, an editor, a writer, and a social media executive. with each role I had to learn a bunch of new skills, software, vocabulary in both languages I speak... etc, 

I've also worked in huge teams up to 30 people, and super small ones (2) and everything in between. Met lots of people, many of whom are hardworking, competitive. Some were manipulative, entitled, low-skilled, etc. 

Each experience has been a learning opportunity. Many were painful and annoying as hell lol but again, you walk away aware these people exist and equipped with the best way to deal with them.

I've been excelling in more job interviews for the past few years because I now have a better understanding of people, professional environments, management styles (to see what a potential boss wants). I've been more comfortable during job interviews, more confident because I know my strong points very well. I'm aware of my weaknesses and I'm focused on the skills I yet need to polish and this determined my last job choice. I feel like I'm doing the best thing I can possibly do for now. I'm not struggling to finish my target. I'm rather content and successful. 

Took me a few years to make enough money to last till the next paycheck (the only downside) but I feel like I'm ready and more stable.

Compared to people my age who spent like 10 years in one position, I can see the difference in skills, in confidence, and in interpersonal skills, and I'm happy with what I have acquired."

If you are unsure about what to take in school.  Pick something general like business... because it segways to many careers, and allows you to enter many industries... even agriculture.  It helped me adapt, and excel in everything I did, hence the progression.

I don't know how easy it is to just move there and find a job.  Personally, I wouldn't move to a different city without any skills, education to fall back on... again.  At least learn to be a bartender or something first.

Moving into the city, going to school, while slowly saving money is a very tough road  especially if that city is Toronto, or Vancouver... actually near 50% of Canadians are spending more than they make\~  Our debt rate is high...

,,Desperate_Honeydew,,,,,"If you want to do something with animals, you could always do groomer school, become a vet tech, trainer, etc. if you would be interested in that sort of change. Grooming and training, if you made your own business, could give you more control over what you do, hours, etc.. 

If you want to do Psych, you could also do online courses (some places have part time, online so you can pay and do it while working, although it may take longer) without having to quit your job, you could have more college credits under your belt and not have to decide on your career just yet. You could also double major if you are able (would probably be more practical if you were a full time student), so you can gain more qualifications for the one career field you may want to be in (say, Bio if you want to generally work with animals, and Psych to work towards a potential Psych career back up if you decide to change). 

I am an INFP-T as well and am going to college online part-time while searching for work presently. I am a Social Work major specifically and spent a lot of time looking at different careers/colleges that would suit my personality and lifestyle. Really happy with my major and my online college.

Like what's been said before, try some online courses to check out what you'll be studying in school. Otherwise, getting some insight on the things you enjoy and combining them into a career choice is something to think about.

Look at some career titles e.g. management consultant, business analysts, counsellors etc. these are very vague titles but the job descriptions can give you a slight idea of what types of things you will enjoy doing at work and then you can focus on the industry you want to be in.

Try asking friends, family friends etc about what they do."

,,bayan963,,,,,"So I'm kind of stuck in the same situation now, even though I graduated 3 years ago. But since you're still in uni, here's my advice. If you like the major you're in but not sure whether you want a career in it, stick to it and try to take elective courses in different subjects to see what might interest you (I don't know what's the system for that there). 

The other thing I would say is, if you truly don't see a future for yourself in teaching any level of education and don't have the patience for it, maybe think about switching majors into something that would work as a base for whatever you see yourself pursuing in the future. If it's nursing maybe consider social studies or biology as those might help you acquire knowledge and skills needed for that kind of career. 

Try to think about what you enjoy doing, and remember that you don't need to rush making this kind of decision, in this day and age people change careers often and it's okay to do so in pursuit of your own happiness and self fulfillment

If you have a guidance counselor at uni or a professor you trust and admire maybe try to get their advice on this and see what they say

Just try to enjoy this time, get good grades so you can qualify for scholarships later if you decide to pursue another level of education. University education isn't just about the major you're taking, it's about learning discipline, time management and networking

One last piece of advice, it's okay to try a few things, internships, part time jobs and such, until you figure out what you enjoy. We don't always have the answers from the beginning but you'll figure it out in time"

That said, you've chosen two careers paths that primarily based on passion and not pay, so you should really go for whichever one you feel more innate drive towards.

Why not? If your goal is to help people, paramedic/EMT may be a career path worth investigating.

> everyone around me seems to know what they want to do 

They don't. Over a half of my high school graduating class switched majors, dropped out, or changed careers within five years.

>the whole dirty jobs you need to do

Tbh, a lot of idealistic kids think that, if they play their cards right, they'll avoid doing ""dirty work,"" but end up doing it anyways. Lots of ""respectable"" jobs in civil or environmental engineering, policing, life sciences, and management end up having to get their hands dirty at some point, so you might as well ball up and get paid for it. If you're only looking for ""clean"" jobs, you might as well only consider being a business, tech or math major."

Here are some books that I bought:
¬∑ Designing your Life x Bill Burnett and Dave Evans (they also have a workbook you can buy separately)
¬∑ What color is your parachute? x Bolles (they have a 2020 version now I believe) (workbook you can buy separately as well; don't let the title mislead you, all career oriented book)
¬∑ Your dream career x For Dummies books (it's also a workbook)
¬∑ Roadmap, The get it together guide for figuring out what you want to do with your life x Roadtrip Nation
¬∑ The crossroads of should and must x Luna (just a little something that makes you question about passions and whether pursuing passions as jobs are a good idea or choosing something a little more realistic, if im not mistaken, it's been a while that I read it)

,,MajorWookie,,,,,"Sooo ime the window to negotiate pay increase is typically right before/during an annual review. I‚Äôm sure you could negotiate your pay at this 6 month renewal but my opinion is that it will depend on these things:

How much ‚Äúleverage‚Äù do you have. Ie: what concrete things have you contributed (projects complete, process improvement, how much they depend on you/require you‚Äôre time, work load, subject experts, performance, etc)

How much will you be asking? If you wanna go from $20/hr to $23/hr MAYBE that‚Äôs something they would do but getting to $25/hr+ is a significant jump. 

It doesn‚Äôt hurt to look for another job and negotiate a higher starting pay there. 

It‚Äôs hard to say ultimately. A lot of specifics contribute to these thing but it in principal it about leverage."
,,,,,,,"As context, I'm a Strat director for an ad agency so I feel your struggles starting out.

In short. Find a new agency because


a) it'll give you leverage to better negotiate (their offer will be peanuts

Failing that. Build the business case for why in $$$ - you did X which generates x revenue or x new business. Can't argue with the numbers."

,,,,,,,"\- The most important health hack I know is **sleep enough/well.** Brain runs effectively on sleep.  Many people interpret this wrong and I dont mean being a bum that sleeps all day. Many people that you see sleeping alot even during the day, actually have terrible sleep that doesnt revitalise them. You need about 6-8 hours, the important part is to wake up in the right phase and sleep well during the time you sleep. **If you do it correctly, you will be completely aware, awake, and you won't need any drugs/coffee to function perfectly.** That leads me to my next (controversial) point.

\- Coffee is fine (at least in normal doses, one or two coffees per day, not massive amounts), and I understand that people sometimes need it to function, but at the end of the day if you can **completely remove it from your system, its best.** At the end of the day it's nothing more than a psychological addiction to caffeine, especially if you sleep bad you feel you need a boost. But if you manage to fix your sleep, you will no longer need it. Just think about this: There are entire cultures (Japan, Eastern Europe, Asia) that can exist without coffee (they drink tea, a much better alternative that doesnt fuck you up as much) so why do you feel its absolutely necessary for existence?

\- Try to cut out technology as much as possible and do real things like reading a book or meditating. That teaches your mind to be strong and not weak."

Anyway, no comment on the computer field, but yes, to become a surgeon, you need top notch grades to first get into medical school. Med school is highly highly competitive. And after you get in, I believe you need to complete a residency in the surgical field before you can become one, but its not a guarantee youll get accepted for a surgical residency. Im not completely certain of everything past the application part, but it is true that it is very competitive to get into med school.

,,MaikaiMaikai,,,,,"Hi, good that you are thinking ahead. What I will suggest is easier said than done, esp at the start. But by all means, START:

1. Don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre motivated or not stressed out. Make a schedule & strictly commit to your production.
2. End your session with an open period (minimum 10-20 mins). Give yourself a chance to step back to look at your project from different perspectives. Envision where you see yourself in the next year, or more.
3. Add the habit of rewarding yourself with a walk, outside time, or something fun in a different room/place afterwards.
4. Once you‚Äôve developed the habit/schedule, see if you can recognize your ‚Äúmore motivated‚Äù days. During those times, ignore the clock & just set your mind to your task. Try to have one of these clock-free sessions every week or two. You‚Äôll be surprised that there CAN be times when you are so immersed that you lose track of time.

TIP: If you think you need TV or music on, I beg you to start with even-toned, wordless, rhythmic themes such as white noise, crickets, rain, instrumentals, classical (not jazz or something syncopated).

For me, it was like doing homework. It was hardest to create the daily habit.

,,Chipahoygirl,,,,,"I'm sorry that you are experiencing this. It doesn't feel nice to be treated like people are ""embarrassed"" of you. 

&#x200B;

It's hard not to take it personally but remember that you cannot control other people's feelings and actions. You do not want to allow yourself to take on her feelings.

&#x200B;

Acknowledge that it does hurt but remember why you wear or do what you do. It's not for other people and it's for you. 

&#x200B;

Don't let her actions force you to react and end up jobless for a while. It affects you as much as you allow it to affect you.... as much as you dwell on the thoughts and feelings and give them power. 

&#x200B;

I would say again acknowledge to yourself that it hurts but then move on and remind yourself that her reaction is her problem/her feelings, it's not yours. Then, choose your thoughts that you want to think on and go do something fun. 

&#x200B;

When the memory of the situation comes again and again,.... acknowledge the thought and feelings and move on to thinking about whatever you care about and want to spend your time thinking about/something fun. You will find that with a little time, the pain lessens!

&#x200B;

Another tip: Sometimes it helps when you imagine an invisible electric fence in your mind and when other people's (baggage, feelings, actions) approaches your yard, then you envision those things not being able to come through the fence into your property / being blocked from you.

I really like the idea of research (microbiology and such), and it would have been something I enjoyed not taking into account work/life balance and pay which are very important to me. However I talked to several pHDs and worked (unpaid -.-) in a research lab for several months. I didn't like what I heard from people I talked, and didn't like what I saw at the lab. Burned out, stressed out people. One who strongly discouraged me from academia. The person I worked for working long hours for very little pay (post doc). Another only could come into work a few days because she was out of funding. That seemed rather unstable, and not worth it.
So I went to industry instead. More money, better hours. It sucks in its own way, but it's still better. 

And when it comes to passions, you really gotta ask yourself how much of a shitty situation you are willing to endure to follow them. Imagine it at its worst, not at its best. 

If I were you I would try and figure out a way to take some classes in that field part time while pursuing your main medical field goals, get to know professors and their work and see if it is right for you. Of course the problem with that is you are talking to the ones who have succeeded, I got lucky and managed to run into a couple who didn't and that was really eye opening.

I personally think you have the right idea of wanting a stable career, but that's just based on my experience/views. For me a job is just a means to an end. My focus will always be on my hobbies, and they aren't exactly stable platforms for a career by themselves. Hopefully one day I can make something of them but gotta make a living in the mean time."

You could also add a description like, ""reviewing/finalizing documents"" or ""completing follow up"". That way it gives your boss the impression you're working so if they inquire or press the situation further, it's just vague enough that you can tailor the response to answer their inquiry so as not to raise suspicion.

That is a fairly open ended question as it really depends on what you consider ""blooming"" to be.

If you consider ""blooming"" as maturing and understanding the ins and outs of your industry, building positive network and relationships, and experiencing various adverse challenges and coming out on top, then I can say that I have bloomed or have gone through blooming at this point of my life.

,,TetrisArmada,,,,,"Might not fully apply since I'm not quite at a place I would settle in to make a career out of, but as far as general office things go:

* I personally believe in letting my work speak for itself. If I produce quality work, and if it's in strong volume and consistency even better, then it says a lot more about who I am as an employee, and any silly office politics that get in the way are heresay.

* Office politics, whether you like it or not, play a bigger role than you think. It's always key to stay out of the ""he-said-she-said"" game, and frankly it's very petty and immature when people do this stuff, but at some point you are likely to get involved one way or another--the extent to which you get involved generally might be to hear the underground news about the company, your or someone else's standing in regards to the job (e.g. Bob got fired for X, Y, and/or Z) though. Not everyone is like this, but there will be plenty who will gossip about a lot of dumb shit that may or may not pertain to you; this is where my first point comes in. Some people will bad-mouth, but if you happen to be in their crosshairs and let's say they're claiming you're a lazy turd, when in fact your work production shows that you're anything but, then you really have little to worry about. It's when management believes, says, and acts on this that should be red flags.

* Have a work-life balance. This one is so crucial... Not every company will honor this, and frankly it's up to you to fight for it. Most jobs will generally be 9-5, do your thing, go home, rinse, repeat. As an employee, I don't think it hurts you to put in overtime here and there, and sometimes you won't exactly have much of a say in it if it's mandatory OT or if you're on salary and you're at a company where it's hail mary time during the 4th Quarter of the year doing damage control for a product your company shipped, but when you do have a say in it? Fight for it. You should work to live, not the other way around. Your mileage may vary though.

* One of the harder things to deal with is to not feel like you're trapped at the place you work. Your mileage will vary on this one too, because there might be a time where the place you're at is a perfectly reasonable commute, good hourly/salary, but there's no internal growth. Whether it's nepotism, favoritism, or any number of bullshit reasons why you're not moving up after putting in a solid amount of time and effort, if management doesn't look out for you then very other few will. It's going to take time to gauge whether your workplace is the kind to foster growth or not, but when you've done everything you reasonably could under the right channels and you're in a position where you're just being burnt out beyond reason with nothing to show for it, it might be a good time to start sending out resumes again.

*******************************

I know a lot of this just sounds terribly negative, but when you find a place to work that has more great than bad you wouldn't need these points of advice. A good thing to keep in mind if nothing else is that you should do your best to contribute to the growth and production of where you work, but not at the expense of your health, sanity, and integrity."
,,jerseygirl222,,,,,"Hire a professional resume company early on. For me, it made a significant difference and resulted in me landing a much better job within 6 months of looking.  I wonder where I would have been if I had done it earlier. "

,,loserstyle,,,,,"Congratulations! Was it in the field that you wanted to work in? Was it a graduate job right out of college or was it an upgrade from the job you were working in now? And how come you decided to hire a professional resume company to edit your resume?

It's interesting how people have different views on this though. Some of my friends say its useless and some say its really good. I guess it really depends on the company that you hired.
"
,,TetrisArmada,,,,,"Sorry for the late reply :)

It's a combination of little mistakes I've made along the way, and what I perceive as how things should be in a work environment, as well as what I hold as personal values.

I personally like letting my work speak for itself: it's not only a testament to my competence and my work performance, but also an insurance against silly heresay that either the management or another co-worker might have towards my work ethic. I've yet to experience any form of backstabbing in that regard, but at the same time I know if it were to happen I can just point at my numbers and show how wrong the claim is without uttering a word.

The office politics in regards to shit-talking amongst co-workers, that one your mileage may really vary; not every workplace does this, but as long as there are people in a given environment there will inevitably be someone that someone else doesn't like. I like staying out of it because it's pointless to get involved in it; someone who talks blatantly about someone else behind his/her back to you could very likely be talking trash about you behind yours. It's another thing to vent with another co-worker you can trust about the work environment, the work load, or something genuinely neutral but also something that everyone else is commiserating with though.

Work-life balance is something that SHOULD be a given, but hardly ever is with a lot of companies and industries. It's something I will actively fight to keep, because my life isn't all about work, and my work is not my life. I can't stand employers who abuse this policy, and will never respect them for doing so even if the mandate to put in more and more work above my limit and at the risk of my health and mental well-being comes from above them, in which case I dislike the company as a whole. It's different if it's an occasional thing where it's hail mary time and things have to get done by a certain point, but with my current job they're mandating it with higher and higher frequency because they're too cheap to hire new people to replace the ones we lost; they're doing nothing to alleviate the increasing workload, while demanding more from the decreasing amount of workers they have because of the shitty management, and that's a huge red flag if there ever was one. I might get paid time-and-a-half, but that's money that I don't feel the need to get because I value my time more than money.

*************************

Sometimes though, you're going to be in a place where you can't reasonably leave your current job without somewhere else guaranteed to take you in with better pay, commute, etc., and you can't necessarily act on your needs because the company holds the threat of firing you over your head if you don't do it their way. It's around this time where you should be gritting your teeth while actively working towards something else, somewhere else, whether it's applying for new jobs elsewhere or getting funds together to start school to finally pursue a degree you need to get a much better career in the same field, or in a new industry altogether. I'm starting classes next week to try to get a degree in computer science; I'm going to be a software engineer, with web development as a back-up. It's great to have long-term goals set up toward something you know you will be far happier with when you achieve it, and my current job is but a means to stay afloat in life so that I can put my efforts elsewhere to improve my life long-term."
,,jerseygirl222,,,,,"It was not out of college, It was a more advanced job in my present field. I think if you're in a very in demand field like IT or a nurse the resume is less important. "
,,YenCe,,,,,Your input has helped me greatly by giving me a better understanding of my situation. Thank you. 
,,TetrisArmada,,,,,"Im glad an old post can still help!

One thing I can impart that might not be on here is that you're never really trapped. At worst you're kind of stuck somewhere but that's usually the cue to seek somewhere else that will better appreciate what you offer as en employee.

At the same time though, there has to be some balancing because it doesnt always do you good to jump from one place to another since that can affect your resume negatively. Not every workplace will be somewhere you consider being in long term but every place you work should give you something good to take away from it to apply elsewhere, whether its work ethic or the kind of work you do.

Mileage will definitely vary for everyone in this regard, but loyalty shouldnt be given to any company unless theyre meeting you half way. "

,,Environmental-Bar-39,,,,,You can do both and try out your music career for a little while and see if has traction. Just because you were accepted to university doesn't mean that you need to do full time.
,,R3DGRAPES,,,,,"If you think pre-med is hard now (you‚Äôre only 18), wait until med school, assuming you get it."
,,TerribleTodd60,,,,,"Since this is a sub for advice I'm going to give you good advice.  Drop rapping and throw yourself at med school.  Rapping is undoubtly more fun.  It is probably satisfying when people enjoy your music and tell you so.  I'm sure it is more attractive in every way than dedicating yourself to 10-12 years of difficult and expensive study.

Almost no one makes it as a rapper.  Even people that are really good.  Even people that are spectacular.  Even people that deserve to make it.  Almost none of them do.  It is  overwhelmingly unlikely you will amount to anything as a rapper.  This is not an indictment of your skill, just a sober assessment of the likelihood of your success.  

School will almost certainly pay off.  The truth is, other than a few options, you need a college degree to achieve success in most industries.  Without one, you are going to have a difficult time competing with your fellow job mates for positions.  You can get it now when you are 18 and can dedicate your energy full time to college.  Or, you can try to get a degree later, when you have to juggle it with your other responsibilities.  I suspect option 1 will be easier, more fun and lead to a better overall outcome.

I'm sure you know that this advice is best.  So few people make it in entertainment and there are so many factors that influence success.  Probably nothing more than simple dumb luck.  College is the way to go, 10 times out of 10.  You are 18 which means you have some time to find you path at school.  Maybe that is on to med school.  Maybe something else, but that is where you should put your time and energy.  Good luck"

,,joemondo,,,,,"Furloughs are basically temporary reduction in hours. They can take a lot of forms, but in pretty much all you are still an employee. You might, for example, have a mandated week off without pay, or you may have every Friday off for 2 months, or fewer hours per day for a period. But you remain an active employee.

In a lay off you are no longer an employee, though in theory you could be called back. In certain industries this used to happen with some frequency. But more often if there is a lay off people are not called back. This tends to be looked on more favorably by potential employers than being fired for cause.

 A hiring freeze simply means an employer is ceasing any new hires, in full or in part. Sometimes a hiring freeze might apply to only a part of the business, or a type of job, or it might be complete with rare specially approved exceptions."
,,k1lky,,,,,How do you lay off people in the past?!
,,Yours_Trulee69,,,,,"Our company furloughed people at the beginning of COVID and one of my direct reports was included. This person stayed on the roster as an employee but had no hours or duties assigned. Some individuals were called back but those that weren't close to a year later were officially dismissed. During furlough, they maintained company provided insurance but still had to pay the employee portion and could also claim unemployment with no objections."
,,candy_burner7133,,,,,Thanks..... what exactly does furlough process entail compared to just firing ( a promise tonfet their jobs back?)
,,False_Risk296,,,,,With a furlough there is likely an anticipated or estimated return date.  If you‚Äôre furloughed the expectation is that one day in the future you‚Äôll be called back to restart work.  On the other hand a layoff or termination is considered permanent.
,,candy_burner7133,,,,,"Thanks for the qualification. Is a company legally of life. To give you a return date, and could they get in trouble for not being so common Is there wiggle room for them to get away with not naming a return Date?"
,,OhShadoobie,,,,,I was furloughed at start of covid with a return date that got pushed a couple times.  The company struggled and the furlough changed to a permanent layoff.  During the furlough period I was able to continue on the company health insurance.  After lay off I was on my own unless I wanted to cobra.
,,False_Risk296,,,,,No they aren‚Äôt legally required to take you back
,,candy_burner7133,,,,,Did you get yo apply for unemployment?
,,False_Risk296,,,,,Sorry to hear that.  How long did it take you to get another job.
,,OhShadoobie,,,,,Yes I was eligible for unemployment during the furlough.
,,OhShadoobie,,,,,It was the best thing that happened to me TBH.  Made a career change and the extra unemployment kickers during covid made it ok financially.  Furlough started March of 2020.  I was officially laid off in June and was working again in September.  Cannot advocate more for having a solid emergency savings to get you through tough times.  When I changed careers I took a hefty pay cut (25% less) to get in the door.  After 3 years I'm almost back to the same pay as 2020
What do you do when you feel like you have nothing to offer but want to change jobs?,14pvt4p,DonutCoffeeSquirrel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/14pvt4p/what_do_you_do_when_you_feel_like_you_have/,5,7,1688420502.0,
,,KennyKenKeeen,,,,,That sounds like a huge lack of self confidence to me. With 15 years of experience in any field there is always something to offer. There are entry level jobs that take people who have no experience so think about that
,,themoirasaurus,,,,,"You have plenty to offer.  There are a lot of skills that are required to do those jobs you have had well.  Sit down and think about what it takes to be good at each one and literally make a list, to start.

If the jobs you want ask for a cover letter, WRITE ONE.  Take that as your opportunity to highlight the skills you have developed (this is where the list comes in handy) at previous jobs that will be useful to you in the job you're applying for.  Sell yourself.  I have been a manager with the job of reviewing cover letters and resumes and trust me, a good cover letter that explains why you are qualified for something you've never done can make a real difference.

When you're interviewed, you will probably be asked questions about how you would translate your past experience into the new job, or why you want the new job, or things along those lines.  Another chance to showcase the experience you have that you can transfer to the new job and show how you will be useful and successful there.

You have more to offer than you think."
,,Givingyoualligot,,,,,"From my experience just some ideas coming from the same background.

1. Apply to a call center jobs in different markets these are great for stepping stone opportunities. Specifically tech support, account management and project management.

2. Use your current employer and ask a higher up to mentor you or ask your boss to create a plan for advancing so you can gain either experience or a promotion.

3. Apply for an entry level position and try to create a resume based off the skills needed for the job. You can take from skills you learned from your past experience but just look a little deeper. 

4. network with others 

5. Go to your local job center and take advantage of free courses that offers certificates of completion for skills like excel, Ms word , typing anything office related. 

6 lastly research you don‚Äôt want to be in a job you will hate."
,,NinjaRecruitment,,,,,"You know, talking with a career coach would be really helpful.  I can totally refer you to someone of you want!   


But really quick, the typical steps you would take with a career coach look like this:   
1. Go through your life/ past jobs and find TASKS (not just ""culture"") that you loved or made you feel fulfilled.   
2. Figure out the career path that fits the tasks you love, brainstorm a bunch.   
3. Pick one that sounds like a good fit, both in terms of your day-to-day and also what you value in life.   
\*\*There are so many jobs that are behind a desk, and you can make tons of money, so right now you have plenty of options\*\*   
4. Dream up that person. The person who you would be if you killed it in the chosen industry.   
5. Map out the journey between who you are now and who you want to be.   
6. Identify your next step.   
7. Create a dossier (resume, cover, LinkedIn) that will get you to your next step.   
8. Get the Job! 

9. Repeat steps 6-8 until you need to have another vision sesh.   


Here's the thing, a good coach will alter these steps for your personal needs and wants. For example, it is hard to know what a good resume looks like and that is why they are there.   


\\\\ Without these steps, it is difficult to really pin down some jobs \\\\  

However, just in case you want to ignore all that and just apply to some places, **here is one**:   
\--*Look up ReminderMedia.* They are looking for entry-level inside sales folks. It's a remote job and they train really well. If you love problem solving/ customer interaction inside sales may be a good option for you.   


You know, talking with a career coach would be really helpful.  I can totally refer you to someone if you want!"

,,Flipflops365,,,,,"For the love of all things, law. My father is an architect and has designed buildings that realistically and conservatively over 90% of Americans have frequented, and will be working until he is almost 80. He has told me that he is thankful that I didn‚Äôt want to take over his firm."
,,Alice_Alpha,,,,,"My understanding is that being a lawyer is like having to write a college term paper every day.  

My understanding of architecture is that they are very, very poorly compensated.  Only a select few break through to generous compensation."
,,Super-Body-7597,,,,,"If you are set on one of these I would go with the law degree as it is much more versatile. 

One more thing for you to consider is psychiatry. Specifically, becoming a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner. The latter is a much shorter career path and still brings in a six figure income in many areas There is a huge shortage of psychiatric providers in the United States and the field is quite lucrative. Psychiatrists are sometimes confused with psychologists.  You want to go the psychiatry route meaning that you will be able to prescribe medication as opposed to only providing therapy. There is also a shortage of therapists (psychologists, counselors and social workers) but those jobs don‚Äôt pay as much."
,,,,,,,All your bad traits point to you not being a lawyer.  Consider another career
,,Never_the_Bride,,,,,Architecture.
,,ArborealRodent,,,,,"Engineering? If you think you can handle law or architecture, I would recommend looking into engineering. There are so many different types of engineering."
,,tingymomo,,,,,"Do NOT go into law. I repeat, do NOT go into law. No flexibility at all and you patience gets tried on a daily basis."
,,Tatersalad00067,,,,,"As a practicing architect, I would recommend interior design, which will require fewer years of education to become licensed/certified and has similar starting pay.  Keep in mind that architecture is a service profession like law, we work for our clients and are paid to solve problems.  I would spend time talking to both lawyers and architects to get a true sense of what their day to day looks like."
,,Environmental-Let526,,,,,A law degree and license offers more versatility. Be prepared to read and write A LOT. Like a fuck ton lot.
,,hongriBoi,,,,,Both are highly saturated fields with not much ROI
,,PandaStroke,,,,,"I suggest talking to practicing lawyers and architects to get more perspective. You mention wanting a good salary. Let's just say both fields aren't great for income especially if you want a family.

Architects don't make much money. They spend years doing grunt work for peanuts in private firms before you could begin to think of owning a practice. It's prestigious but not a money maker.

Law is particularly bad for life work balance. Law in America has a bifurcated Salary band. Those who make six figures and those who don't. Since you mention you like helping people. The altruistic side of law doesn't make much money. And for the money maker side, you need to have graduated from a top school, be top of class and be willing to work 60 plus hours a week for at least 5 years.

That proposition could make sense if you're twenty something and childless, not when you're late 30s and want to start a family.

Either proposition requires you to start from the bottom of the career ladder and that's challenging in your thirties.  I suggest building on your existing career.  What would it take for you to get to the top?  

If you want to switch completely, then healthcare seems more appropriate."
,,themoirasaurus,,,,,"*I am really attracted to get a law degree as it will be a great challenge and I will feel proud of myself and I will be able to fully work after 3 years. Rewarding aspect about law degree is that I always worked with people and I will be helping them. The job is in demand, so there is less begging for job aspect.* 

I have a law degree.  Yes, it is a great challenge and you will feel proud of yourself.  No, you will not be able to fully work after 3 years - you don't learn how to practice law in law school.  You learn how to think like a lawyer and how to read and understand legal opinions.  If you're lucky and your law school has a strong writing department, you also learn how to write like a lawyer.  Law school doesn't even prepare you for the bar exam; you have to take a course that costs several thousand dollars to prep for the bar if you want a chance of passing it.  Yes, the job is in demand, but there are more lawyers out there looking for the jobs you want than there are jobs to be had.  You have to be really smart about the (unpaid) internships you take during your summers and finding a job is way harder than you think it is.

Besides all that, what is it about actually *practicing* law that interests you?  If you don't know, then you might want to think twice about getting a law degree.  It's a long and expensive three years -- I owed over $100,000 in student loan debt after I graduated."

,,Floflorflor,,,,,"Wow, thank you so much for this point of view. I was actually thinking about psychiatry as a potential area of interest but removed it from my list due to extended educational requirement"
,,SF_turophile,,,,,"Nope. I only advise you do it if you have a burning desire or passion for it. I work in the industry, but I am not an architect."

,,Meat_Dragon,,,,,"So I have BA is Psychology and 10yes ago (god I feel old lol, I am 40 if your wondering) was working as a Psych-Tech in inpatient Psych facility at a hospital. I loved my job and was told by others I was good at it. Then I was head-hunted for the first time and was pressured/encouraged to take this management position.

At first it felt really good to be wanted, and the position could be a major step towards something, where there is no future in being Psych-Tech‚Ä¶ like you have to go back to school for something to progress (phlebotomy, ER training or get a master‚Äôs degree) so I saw this as a real chance to improve my life. 

However, I should have been able to tell the company was F‚Äôd up through the hiring process, but I ignored the signs because I wanted the job. Well on unrelated matters the dude that sweet talked me into taking the job left the company. Then I became an inherited project the new guy gets to deal with, there were issues right away and it was obvious a power struggle between us was going to happen because of this dudes confrontational style and him being overwhelmed also because there was like no training and you had to figure it out on your own most of the time. Then the dude changed a policy that literally made hours almost double. Like an unannounced jump from 40hrs/5days a week, to 65+hrs and being on call everyday- exactly what I did not want‚Ä¶ to be stuck in a job I increasingly hate and forced to work way more then originally promised. So I quit.

I know the situation isn‚Äôt exactly the same but I thought I would tell you that do to some other changes that happened at the same time, I switched jobs slightly and wound up meeting my ex-wife, who gave me two kids, who are everything to me now. Life takes turns we can‚Äôt expect‚Ä¶ all you can do is roll with the punches, reinvent yourself in someway and try again. Everyone takes jobs they wind up regretting, it is a very very common story unfortunately. So don‚Äôt let it get you down because your next move might be the one that gets ya to where ya you want to be. Don‚Äôt quit, and don‚Äôt go backwards. Move forward like nothing happened and don‚Äôt let it get you down. How could you have known your job was going to turn to shit immediately after starting? This isn‚Äôt on you, shitty company, your not a bad worker or something. Well I hope my long rambling story helps in some way. Another thing you do when your 40‚Ä¶ lol, long rambling stories."
,,Initial_Link_220,,,,,"As aitakes over. One of the first things lost will be office jobs. Instead of doing what everyone does and look for a bigger building to work in for a bigger business. You'd probably be well suited to find a smaller business that deals with something you have passion for beyond ""office job"". Or consider government jobs in your area. As unions will likely keep you in work there for many years to come"
,,katie-potatie,,,,,"I feel this as I'm in a similar boat. I left a job I loved for another company because an old boss of mine that I loved convinced me to join her doing the same work but with a lot more money.

She conveniently forgot to mention that the company has been dealing with a lot of sexual harassment issues and that the office itself has super draconian rules that make it miserable to be there.

So my role on the unit changed to leading more groups, doing some 1on1 counseling and a few other things that I would get to do in my role as a Psych Tech but not very regularly. So I finished and just transitioned title because I was already doing Social Worker work. In some states there are advanced psych tech roles that can do much of the work an MSW does and is additional schooling to qualify for. I loved being a Psych Tech but it definitely is a dead end job without additional something. In my state you can use work experience under an MSW to earn your CADC (Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor) with out any formal schooling, just about 2 years of work experience but there is not a huge jump in pay, which is why I went the MSW route. I was able to pay for most of my School expenses via working during my internship. If it was truly ‚Äòunpaid‚Äô I never would have been able to finish or afford school."

,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"If you are young don't stress too much about finding your calling right away. While the psychological tests and counselors' advice will give you somewhere to start it's not a complete solution.

I remember I got such interesting professions in those test and my counselors wanted me to go into something I already knew I would hate.

Anyhow, one thing that can be really helpful is to explore different paths and careers. You can learn about different professions or trades on YouTube. Get the basics from the videos, but then try to go inters or work with someone for day that is in the professions you are interested in. Ask them to tell you the harsh truth about the role. What's the great, good, bad and awful of the role.  

Doing this and trying a role hands on will give you a better idea if you would like to pursue this career long term.

You can also try different things at home. For example, let's say you are interested in Marketing or pluming. You can create a project where you practice marketing school. You can buy a set of pipes and try to install some plumbing.

You can also think about what is your ideal time of interaction with customers or staff on a daily basis. If you love being around people probably a people facing role will suit you well. 

Do you have any current particular interests in life? Any hobbies? Talents?"

Analyzing the shit other people do- you have to be smart and a little ruthless or its a dead end."

,,VulcanMind1,,,,,"Huge difference between director and camera operator!

I'd recommend you get involved now in any College Theater programs for volunteer work and start networking and volunteering in any small movie production locally that might need a grip, gaffer, or general labor. Specify the days and times you can work to hopefully get something to build your resume.

The theater program is good since you will network with actors and one of them might make it big that you can keep in touch with for future jobs.

Don't let your ego get in the way to start at the bottom of doing general labor on a film set. You need to learn how the ful set should operate before you can start screaming at them like Tom Cruise because you KNOW they are not doing their job since you've done it before.

I like the idea of your major. The friends I know in the movie industry oftentimes ended up moving out of it. The pay to make costumes or prosthetics isn't great when you factor in unemployment between movies compared to making prosthetics for healthcare."
,,dakhat7788,,,,,"How are your grades? Could you go apply to a school like the University of Texas at Austin and dual major in Radio-Television-Film (RTF) and something lighter like psychology or communications?

,,Arbernaut,,,,,"Just a heads up: you don‚Äôt really need to go to film school to get into a film career. Many of the directors, DOPs and camera ops I know have come at it in different ways. Some directors came from making short films, went into advertising and worked their way up to directing films and TV shows. Some DOPs did the same, others worked their way up from clapper loaders to 1st ACs to operators to director of photography. There‚Äôs no one set path; but the consistent thing is having the drive, desire and energy to do it regardless of the route. Source: I work in the industry as both director and DOP.

,,carpetbombcalifornia,,,,,I've switched jobs multiple times over last 8 years. You won't believe how many times. Thinking better company. Better pay. Better career path. Don't exist. All corps are sheisty. All jobs dead end. Working for someone in same or similar career always has same result. Burn out. Aside from becoming a start up it's all the same. Though start up take time money u may or may not have. But payoff there. Work when you want. Growth if you want. Definitely not boring. But may be devastating.
,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"At the end of the day we all want a happy healthy work and life situation. Maybe decide if you really enjoy the job you are currently doing or if you really need a higher salary? How much do you value the flexibility given by your current company? There may be a higher paying job out there but they may not be as flexibility so you have to decide what's most important to you.

Personally, I have been in similar situations as yourself. I had considered going to another company or even another role within the same company, but then I thought about what I love most about my life and it was having the flexibility to be around my spouse all the times and be able to spend time with family and friends. Also to be able to learn and create things outside of my role in my spear time. Some jobs consume even your thoughts outside of work. 

However, if you have been there a while, always ask for a raise, every single year (if not every 6 months). Continually ask for opportunities to grow or learn more. Or take it upon yourself to learn something new outside of work."
,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"Seek professional advice: Consider seeking advice from a career coach, mentor, or trusted professional who can provide you with objective insights and guidance. A career coach or mentor can help you clarify your career goals, explore your options, and develop a strategic plan for your career advancement. As for me, I have used [CareerFitter](https://www.careerfitter.com/free_test/careerbuilder?afid=1710) before during I felt stuck in my career.

The decision to leave a comfortable job depends on your personal career goals, aspirations, and job satisfaction. It's important to carefully evaluate your options, do thorough research, and seek professional advice if needed. It's also worth considering the potential for growth and advancement within your current company. Remember, taking risks and making strategic career moves can lead to new opportunities and growth in your professional journey. Good luck!"

,,scruffybeard77,,,,,Very often the best person to fix a problem is not the person who made the mess.  Stepping up to get your team out of a jam hardly makes you a pushover.  Be sure to put this on your next performance review.

,,carpetbombcalifornia,,,,,Depends
,,No-Bear1401,,,,,"There's context needed, and there are multiple angles this can be seen from.

A lot of people are bringing up recognition, appreciation, or compensation. But there's another one. What is the nature of the job? Simply put, my job is to keep planes from going into the ground at a high speed. That is what is important to me in my job. I don't care who's at fault, who is a pushover, who gets the attaboy. Pilots and passengers don't care about that either. Other jobs have different priorities and as an employee your priorities will vary as well. 

So to your question: you'll have to answer it. What is important to you in your situation? Is the end product of the job something you feel is worth stepping up for, or is the compensation or recognition more important? If there is no benefit to stepping up  and the end product isn't critical, then you probably are getting into pushover territory."
,,TheCallousBitch,,,,,"TLDR:  **This problem at work‚Ä¶ do not think about it like ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs mess I have to clean.‚Äù Think about it as ‚Äúthis is my chance to build a great story for the next interview - the time I solved a major problem through hard work and dynamic problem solving.‚Äù** 

What you are describing is the difference between someone who has a career and someone who has a job. 

In a job, you are paid to do a task for a set number of hours. There are millions of white collar, office work jobs, exactly like this. You do your tasks (analyze the data, review the legalese, crunch the numbers), then you go home. You don‚Äôt create/build ideas/plans/strategies/solutions. 

In a career, you are invested in the short and long term outcomes of your projects/impact, your team, your org, and the company as a whole. You 100% can (and should) have boundaries that promote work/life balance and allow you to manage your workload effectively. There will even be times where the right call for your team is to say ‚Äúnot our circus.‚Äù

There are millions of jobs that one person can treat it as a ‚Äújob,‚Äù while the guy in the cubicle next to him, treats it as a career. 

The question you have to ask yourself, is what do YOU want from your job. Do you want to build a career, move up the ladder to middle, then senior, management? Do you want to stay an individual contributor, but make it to the absolute top of the pay bracket in your field, at the top company in your field? Do you just want enough cash to cover the basics in life and health insurance, and you don‚Äôt care about the 40 hrs a week it takes to get there?

Whatever you want is totally fine. Job or career. Ask yourself what type of work/job title you want ten years from today, 20 years from today, and when you retire. Then ask yourself what you need to do to get there. Someone who wants to just do tasks be earning $60k a year and a pension when they reach retirement, is going to have a very different approach than someone who plans to retire as COO of a fortune 1000 company. 

For your life plans: Can you just keep your head down and do the bare minimum? Fantastic. Do you need to get more certifications, but otherwise just keep working as you are? Cool. 

Do you need to rely on other people to promote you or hire you, to achieve your goals? Then you need to think about work in terms of resume building. **This problem at work‚Ä¶ do not think about it like ‚Äúsomeone else‚Äôs mess I have to clean.‚Äù Think about it as ‚Äúthis is my chance to build a great story for the next interview - the time I solved a major problem through hard work and dynamic problem solving.‚Äù**"

Unfortunately, a lot of employers want owner-level commitment from employees. No amount of ‚Äústepping up‚Äù will give you owner-level compensation."

,,pinkyoner,,,,,"Tbh you probably don't change jobs with out a combination of all 4 to varying degrees.

Imo $$$ is the biggest factor in any job, followed by the people then how satisfying/ fulfilling the job is.

Worth noting I believe burnout is a direct result of poor pay, poor management, unsatisfying work and shitty coworkers"
,,Drev92,,,,,"For me the salary is doubled in 5 years, and it's more than double as the average salary in my country. People call me crazy, but I still want to change job.

We started to using a technology developed by a partner company last year with no documentation at all. When they started the whole project, there was at least a very minimal description on the tool's website, but there were pages which doesnt even exist on the docs (some page content was: ""TODO: write documentation"" lol, and we are talking about official documentation).

So it's a thing that this tool is not used anywhere worldwide (no joke), but after 1 year this company rewrote the whole project before they gave it to us to their own framework. So now that minimal documentation is useless as well which you can find.

Even google doesnt know this tool :D

Just an example:

Modern frameworks has 300k+ questions in programmer forums like stackoverflow, this tool has 100 questions, 80% not even answered.

We try to learn the system, but it's a torture, the whole tool is a mess, and we miss the deadlines as well, because we are in learning phase for a long time.

Not even talking about that you cant even mention this tool in your CV, because it is as useful as you wouldnt even write it there, so it doesnt even help to move in your career.

But since this experience is useless, I try to educate myself in my free time, and every weekend, so I dont have time for anything else :D :D Without experience I would earn approximately half the salary as here, but I dont care, at least I would learn something useful, it's worth much more in the long term. It's a very very big lesson for me, that money doesnt make you happy, and it's true.

I didnt want to complain, I just wrote it down, whats the background to change :)"

It's a useful framework for thinking about your career. Because you might love something but not want to work in it. And that's ok. 

My advice is to go out and experiment. Use that amazing curiosity and explore things. That's the best way to actually gather 'data' for yourself and figure out whether your interests match your skills or talents. There's no right way."
,,justsomeguy32,,,,,"You need a role where you can apply a passion for learning about a diverse range of topics to problems that people will pay you to solve. Your preferred options will further narrow as you spend more time thinking about the kinds of work products you like to produce, which you didn't cover in your post.

However, the problem I kept having all my life is that I've been afraid of trying new things because of this immense fear of failing. I guess I thought that it would confirm all of my biggest insecurities like just not being ""smart enough"". I know you have to be bad before you get good at something but I would always just take it too personally. I realize it has to change though. It's better to try and fail than to be stuck like this for years. I've decided that I'm going to work on that actively this year.

,,scha_den_freu_de,,,,,"That information is usually passed on in aggregate form for mandatory annual EEOC reporting. The hiring managers do not see it for each individual.

Know that a lot of employers are receiving hundreds of applications per each job listing (obviously industry and location plays a factor). Make sure you are tailoring your resume to include the keywords used in the job listing. Many use ATS (Applicant Tracking Software) and that auto-scans and sorts applicants based on how well a resume matches up. ATS does not use EEO answers in the sorting process."
,,MixPsychological4423,,,,,"I‚Äôve been told to decline all demographic info until after hired and if you need accommodations, wait until you‚Äôre on boarded."
,,Cookie8119,,,,,"I'm in two minds about doing this... I have a disability and I have often chosen not to disclose until after I've secured the role. 

In the UK,  a lot of companies now claim to be ""disability confident "" which means, if you meet the minimum criteria, you'll be guaranteed an interview.  However, I'm aware it has been used to disregard applications.  The same with ticking the ethnicity box."
,,Arcades_Samnoth,,,,,"That makes sense - it's going to make me wonder though when i'm getting interviews for the same job in other companies that didn't ask this lol.  

For me it sometimes an issue because this factors in if I can drive/relocate so not mentioning right away when they ask seems peculiar so it's always a difficult situation."
,,scha_den_freu_de,,,,,"Any reputable company required to collect that data would not use it as a factor in hiring or not. It is illegal for them to use that information for discrimination and a reason why hiring managers don't see it. If they don't know, there is no unconscious bias.

Those other companies may not have to submit an annual EEO 1 report and therefore don't ask. The report is required of all private sector employers with 100 or more employees, and federal contractors with 50 or more employees meeting certain criteria, that they have to submit demographic workforce data, including data by race/ethnicity, sex, and job categories.

You should only bring up specifics of a disability after receiving an offer along with any reasonable accommodations you may need."

The real worst case scenario is you keep working there for 2 years and rejected the bonus.

If you want to express discomfort with it, specify you only pay it back if it‚Äôs your decision to leave."
,,,,,,,3k bonus is like an extra paycheck which is kinda insulting when you‚Äôre being underpaid. Find a new job and reply back to them that you found a company that values your work and experience. They can use that 3k they offered you as a bonus to hire a replacement
,,PhrohdohsBabe,,,,,"If you don't feel right taking it, don't take it.

A $3k bonus with a clawback is a slap in the face when you're already being underpaid. I found out earlier this year that I was getting paid slightly over half what the other person with my job was getting paid. I also asked for a 20% raise and I got a 7% raise with an over $5k bonus. I'm happy I got something, but I'm looking for other jobs anyway. I would have quit on the spot if they gave me the offer you received. Don't let a job disrespect you."
,,No-Music-5538,,,,,"I work in payroll at a company in 28 states, some states won‚Äôt allow you to take it back even with the contract and others will only allow them to deduct up to the amount of your last check. If either of those are the case you could quit the first day of a new pay period and come out ahead with them deducting only one day of pay, just depends on your state laws. 

I would look into it for your state because it may be specific to what they call the bonus and weather you are hourly/salary/bonus employee but if you take it there is a chance you can keep some or most of it."

A. Tell them no thank you and they could be petty and make your life harder. Try to fire you and get ahead of black balling you

B. Say yes but don‚Äôt spend the money. Get a cashiers check and set it aside until you‚Äôre ready to leave and give it back to them. This would blind side them because they most likely would be treating you like dirt because they KNOW you can‚Äôt afford to pay back the $3K and will hold it over your head. 

C. You take the cash and spend it they OWN you for a year maybe two. They can treat you anyway they want. This is like boring money from the mob but they can use the courts to break your fingers"

,,Manonthemon,,,,,"As far as I can see, you have three options:

1. Find a remote position in a local company.
2. Find a remote position in an overseas company.
3. Freelance.

Option one and two will entail searching and applying for jobs. I'm guessing pay would be better with an international company, but look out for businesses who seek cheap labour abroad, pay local rates and provide no workers benefits. Option 3 will entail self-marketing and looking for clients, probably difficult initially, potentially rewarding over long run. 

You seem to have a mix of interesting skills, you can use them to search for jobs on Indeed, LinkedIn etc. I won't tell you what's the exact job you can find, your search results will. Maybe it's digital marketing? SEO? Software development or anything else in between.

You can also use an online skills assessment tool to push you in the right direction. For example this:

https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/skills-assessment"
,,kickrocks876,,,,,"I'm also from a developing country and I've worked remotely for a few companies in the US.

1. Build a portfolio:
Showcase a few writing samples, designs or tech projects you made. These don't have to be paid. They can be things you did in class or your free time.

2.Join remote job search platforms:
I've had success with Upwork and local jobs boards that post overseas remote work 


But some other more technical and competitive ones are  remoteOk, weworkremotely and LinkedIn. I haven't had success with these. 

3. Make sure your resume is suitable for the culture of the company.
I know some countries put marital statuses etc and that is not always acceptable. Look at resume samples in that country. You can find resume templates free on Canva. 

4. Have a professional image online. 
You don't need to be popular. Just have a professional and clean image on LinkedIn. Look at profiles of people doing what you want to do. Connect with people in your country and people in the country you want to work in.

If you join Upwork make sure to put effort into your account.  Add a photo, add samples and a nice simple bio. Look at other profiles for guidance. 

5. OPTIONAL. There are free easy courses online that are accepted. 
This might be tough to do with school so this is totally optional."

If you have a great relationship with the hiring manager then a conversation would be worthwhile. If on the other hand management feels like you are given an opportunity to prove yourself - that is you may be over your skis - then tread lightly.   In any case I would recommend never to take the first offer without negotiating or at least trying to.

,,AqualineNimbleChops,,,,,"I think you've already identified the best places to start which would be to address your confidence and self-esteem issues. 

Don't resign yourself to just ""having low self esteem and confidence"" for the rest of your life. 

Take a proactive approach to fix these areas and I guarantee the career clarity will come throughout the journey. 

Some pointers:
- Learn about self esteem. What it actually is and isn't. Behaviors and choices that support high levels of it and those than lower it. Try the book Six Pillars of Self Esteem to start. 

- Step just an inch outside your comfort zone. Then another inch and then another. Toastmaster and Dale Carnegie Training are a great place to start. Engage fully in whatever you do. 

- Exercise, eat well, and take care of your body. Higher self esteem and higher confidence will follow.

- Talk it out. With friends. With family. With a therapist or behavioral coach.  

- Immediately stop doing anything that makes you feel bad about yourself. Things like drugs, porn, TikTok etc.. not saying these are bad per se, but if you don't feel good about something then cut it out of your life. 


Address the problem and you heal. Address the symptoms alone and you don't truly heal."
,,kudomudo,,,,,"Step by step, understood. Thank you for instilling these! Appreciate your kind words"
,,AqualineNimbleChops,,,,,"Exactly! 

Check out the book growth mindset by Carol Deck too. 

I'd also suggest that you do some personality test. The paid, detailed versions. Part of being confident and having self esteem is knowing and accepting yourself. 

You can do these at home from your computer. 

P.s. everything I've suggested I've done because I've been where you are now. These aren't passing suggestions."

,,Glimothy,,,,,"Unionized blue collar employee here. Just started in a new department with a company I have been employed with for 15 years. I am treated like a brand new employee even though my seniority trumps 3/4 of the other workers. I am new in the dept, but I am not 'green'.

My new managers have mentioned they are watching the cameras around the shop (cameras are for security reasons, not to watch / discipline employees.) I am to 'look busy' when in between projects. I was working in a dusty environment and stepped outside to take 5 minutes of fresh air after already worked through my break/lunch, and one of the managers snuck up on me using the cameras to know exactly what corridor I would be outside of, scared me by kicking a metal drum, and then reprimanded me for not being productive, even though I had already completed my work orders for the day and was finding other work to keep busy.

There is constant threats of ""I'll come check on you in a little while."" as if I'm a child. In my last department I was respected and left alone to do my duties. There was also managers reprimanded for stalking workers on cameras recently in the company. These are high end cameras with zoom features and microphones. I feel like they are getting away with this creepy behaviour because nobody has stood up to the management about this issue, and being the new guy, I don't want to put a target on my back. If it continues I will contact the union, but I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions.

Thanks in advance."

,,Neel_LifeCoach,,,,,"You are doing a wonderful job , working with angels. Yes children are angels , may be naughty but they have far better emotions than in the adult world. So believe me, working with them is far more peaceful than if you would have been dealing with adults in your work environment.

It would be better, to be on the look out for similar or higher  position available in the same sector. Since you have the experience for 6 years, you can think of shifting elsewhere , in the same field but with a higher pay. By hopping job, you are increasing your chance for a higher pay till you feel satisfied. 

However, do weigh the higher pay with the quality of work too. You are looking for a higher pay  and a better life too. there is no fun if you get paid more but are miserable in your work environment.

My advice has been based on what you have written , but with experience I know, the first narrative that I hear is only 50% true and additional 50% are new elements which comes out after I interview the coachee.

Keep that in mind , if you need anything more, you can let me know or, DM me if it is too personal.

Thanks"
,,Neel_LifeCoach,,,,,"I understand that you value and respect your work. You have been there for 15 years and have been doing well. You new managers in your new department are not making it easy for you. The behavior you described make me think of modern slavery.

I would say that you should protect your interest and work out a way. Options for you  are to expose your managers  covertly , if possible to shift back to your earlier department or to another department.

You have a Union , and the union can put up check without exposing your identity, if you are not the only employee facing this kind of behavior from your managers. 

In any case, these are options just based on what you have written here. it may well be that on further investigating from you, some of them might not even work.

Keep your calm and work out your way for a better work environment. What is happening to you is not normal and you certainly you  deserve something better. 

I cannot give specific advice as I have not questioned you to find out more about your work environment. I hope this helps.

,,Neel_CertCoach,,,,,"I think you hit the right button. You need to build on your confidence which was apparent as from your first paragraph.

You are certainly better than many and do represent a threat to them as you would out do their performances , however what is missing is that you need to prepare yourself to tackle the 90 % of your daily task , which is to deal with uncooperative, discouraging and manipulative people around. 

Going to another workplace can be a solution but you still carry your vulnerabilities. I would prefer, that if you decide to leave a job it should be out of choice for something better and not due to compulsion. 

So Stay strong and learn how to fight back, gracefully but firmly.

You just need to be coached and prepared for that, and test yourself in the same environment, to get your confidence back. Let me know your thoughts.

,,PutSimply1,,,,,"Firstly, great question 

It's fantastic that you've identified this, and you even describe it as a 'cushy' job - I've totally totally been there

My invitation to you, is to consider whether you are genuinely happy where you are, if you are not, you are in the wrong job my default 

You need to feel satisfied with what you do. For me, i could not bare wasting 8-10 hours a day, I value my time, regardless of the pay i was getting which was pretty good

Look into the future, and see if you like the person you would become if you stayed where you are - for me it was a straight no, someone unenthusiastic, floating through, wasting time and growing in no particular way 

My advice would be to take the position, introduce some turbulence to your life, once you're in the thick of any problems that arise you are aware enough (proof shown by writing your post) to solve those problems and grow to a better version of yourself

You're in a trap at the moment, **many linger in unsatisfying jobs for life and then end up 60 years old wondering about the person they never became**

,,fleeceman,,,,,"I was in a similar situation and made the switch from consulting to development a few years ago.

I opted to quit my previous job and enrol in a full time bootcamp. I would recommend going that route if possible as it really speeds up the process of getting up to an employable junior level if you're coding all day every day. 

I also found my current dev job in a careers fair hosted by the bootcamp I attended."
,,coachzuzana,,,,,"Hello

I'm unsure of what 'technical' steps are required to make the switch but all I know as someone that works with developers is they are hard to come by - it's a market where the demand is considerably higher than the pool of people - so I say go for it you will be happier and wealthier - just find a way how you can start applying for jobs and what they say. Plenty of remote roles available as well."
,,mtor_mentoring,,,,,"Great question, I run a free mentoring slack channel to help with this, we offer career advice and connections to those in tech from around the world :) - [https://mtor.io](https://mtor.io)

But to answer some here, I read this as a few things:  


1) your social anxiety is a becoming a blocker, and even in coding you will be communicating in stand-ups, or peer reviews all the time... so if I were you, this would be a focus point of gradual improvement (which it sounds like you have been doing!)  


2) You can learn from less demanding courses for sure, but the quality of the teaches are so so at best in some cases, therefore if this is a career switch you truly want, I would set myself up financially as best as I can for a 12 month period and then leave my current job. Enrol in a 6 month bootcamp and then give yourself 6 months to find a new job.  


6 months to find a job might seem high, but trust me (recruiter in tech here), it is a weird market at the moment, so best to be safe than sorry! I hope this helps :)"

,,DaveyCrockett99,,,,,"I never understood how a teenager is expected to pick a major and choose what they want to do for the rest of their life. Many people don't find out what they want to do until well after college. 

My advice would be to find a major/career path that isn't too specialized. Find something that has a skill set that is easily transferrable between a number of your interests. For example Business Management and Computer Science both have many branching career paths, but if you do something like Geography or History those only have a handful of options.

You certainly don't have to use what you studied in school, but it definitely helps. Here are a few things I wish I knew when I was in your situation:

1. It's okay to switch majors
2. It's okay to have no idea what you're doing with your life
3. Most adults don't know what they want to do either
4. Make sure your job isn't your life. A job can be a way to get money and you can (and should) have passions and interests that you devote time to outside of work."

,,Retexee,,,,,"I was in a similar situation 6 years ago. Finished my PhD in physics, but realized that employers were usually looking for very specific experiences. Almost all hiring managers had the mindset that if you hadn‚Äôt done certain things, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it in the future. 
Six months later, after hundreds of applications and about 5 interviews, I was eventually hired as an electric engineer but they basically treated me like a fresh undergraduate (pay wise and task wise). I tried to ask for a little bit more money at that time but they wouldn‚Äôt give it to me. It was ok, I knew my situation. However, in the last 6 years, I learned a lot in that job, and I was also able to learn quickly and grew very fast. 5 years later I had been promoted twice by that company and offered a job by another company. I now make twice as much and my previous company basically begged me to stay. 
All I can say is that get whatever you can now if you want to leave school, a PhD in a non academic business usually don‚Äôt mean too much.

,,SkullAngel001,,,,,">I don't really have a lot of interest in continuing to teach, and I think it would make it harder to transition out going forward.

The reason some people go for their PhD isn't to teach; it's because they're so passionate about their area of expertise that they want to study and research it to the point where they discover new things and publish their research via an academic institution. The teaching part is a basic formality for tenure and many departments utilize grad student assistants to teach entry level stuff like Pre-Calc & first semester Calculus allowing tenured professors to focus their time on researching & publishing. But for the most part, having a PhD means you eat, sleep, and poop your discipline. Outside of academia, this is both a blessing and a curse. 

Regarding the public sector issue, from my experience this is a mixed bag. From a technical hiring perspective, if the job says it requires a Master's/MS or higher, the computer will give you extra points for your PhD resulting in your application looking better than your competition. However, as a you mentioned, government entities often drag their heels in the hiring process due to countless reasons beyond your control so I wouldn't bet the farm on one agency. 

>I have applied to tons of both private and public, but not really academia.

What you should do is adopt a more focused approach. In the case of private sector jobs, focus on companies like Qualcomm, Google, IBM, Boeing, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, etc. where the company's products & services can utilize your mathematical experience in an analytical, statistical, or manufacturing optimization capacity. 

Same thing with the public sector government agencies. Focus on jobs with the NSA (highest employer of mathematicians), DoD, NASA, Space Force, CDC, FBI, etc.

In the meantime while you're trying to score something from the above, you can market yourself as a professional tutor, hire clients/students to keep you financially afloat while you job hunt. There are plenty of websites that need STEM tutors for both domestic and foreign students along with privatized in-person tutoring for more one-on-one learning."

Is it common in the US to have 4 steps hiring process?,ofyp0f,thetitans89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ofyp0f/is_it_common_in_the_us_to_have_4_steps_hiring/,6,20,1625714010.0,
,,nanakapow,,,,,"The first interview sounds like they aren't reading your CV/resume, rather it's being pre-filtered by a 3rd party (HR?), then they expect to just talk through that. When in fact even that first interview is a two-way conversation. Yes they should expect you to talk about your CV, but your and their working approach should absolutely be part of that first interview, or how do you know if you want to spend half a working day doing their writing test?

I know you're not going to change their minds on the above, but expect the whole company to potentially be a bit micromanaged if this is how they do hiring."
,,RDPCG,,,,,"In my experience, the first interview (or phone call) is generally a screening interview setup by the hiring manager to weed out people who they don't want ""wasting the hiring manager's time."" Once you make it past that step, depending on the organization, you'll either speak directly with the hiring manager next or perhaps, another bullshit round with a recruiter or something else. 

I've had 7 rounds of interviews at one company only to be ghosted at the end. I've had 3 interviews with one company plus an exercise which took me 8 hours to complete (also to be ghosted at the end). I'd say three rounds is pretty standard (plus the ghosting), but some companies really like to waste time and money by taking the interview process to the next level."
,,,,,,,This is completely normal and even would consider to be on the lower end. 7-9 nowadays is more normal.
,,branden3112,,,,,This is excessive.
,,neverthxt,,,,,"This has always been the case for me including assessments I did offline sometimes. 

I will say, you wouldn‚Äôt move forward through the steps if they deemed you unfit. If you do go through all steps, high probability they‚Äôre seriously considering you. 

I hope you get it!"
,,thetitans89,,,,,"I do agree with you on the first point.
About the test, it‚Äôs not the first time the organization expected me to spend that much time.
My view on the other is bit different. I believe they tried to prevent micromanage by overdo it when hiring"
,,schillerstone,,,,,"I would have been tempted to politely decline on the 8 hour project (!), but I haven't been faced with it. Sounds ridiculous. Do you work in a very high paying field?"
,,thetitans89,,,,,"Little update, the manager answered my email and clarified that she signed off for vacation and would reach back after two weeks.
At least I am not ghosted :)"
,,thetitans89,,,,,"That's sound bad.

All the effort to be ghosted in the end. I supposed you have a good job now and can turn back and thank those missteps"
,,thetitans89,,,,,"Woa, it‚Äôs great to know"
,,thetitans89,,,,,"I am not sure if it's excessive or not.

There are some reasons behind this: they are a new org, the work is remote, ... So they want to make sure to hire the right guy that suit the org culture and can really do the job."
,,thetitans89,,,,,"Thank you.
I have one more week till the reply (told by hiring manager).
I feel the interest come both way during the interviews but after reading a bunch of stories on r/jobs I am not so sure :))
Of course, I will never stop improving myself (pandemic makes me taking online courses seriously)"
,,nanakapow,,,,,"Similar tests are routine in my industry too, but I'd never do one without having had an interview with my potential manager first. I get that this is a remote position, and there's an element of filtering going on, but unless there's a huge number of applicants, it feels a bit much. 

On the overdoing it now, so we can give you free rein later, that might be what they're telling themselves, and you. But I doubt it's how it will work out.

Do you know if the role is new/what the turnover is for similar remote roles within the org? Is there anything on Glassdoor, or anyone you can connect with on LI to discuss?"
,,RDPCG,,,,,"I agree with you, actually. For better and worse, moving forward I plan to politely decline to provide free work or better yet, provide a higher-level summary as opposed to a full walk-through on a project (something that will show my skills and knowledge without giving away the keys to the castle).

To be honest, the organization is very reputable, but after doing some more research (after my interviews, etc.), I actually believe there was no position opening and that they were actually looking for free work. The reason I believe this: they were hiring for other roles at the same level and every role they filled received a small press release. They never had a press release issued for this particular role and I never knew of anyone filling it (I'm in a small field so generally news gets around).

I'm in a specialized field; however, salary varies substantially from industry to industry and from organization to organization.

Edit: words"
,,RDPCG,,,,,That‚Äôs a good sign that they‚Äôre keeping the line of communication open. Good luck!
,,RDPCG,,,,,"I wouldn't consider them missteps because there's not much I would change on my end when it comes to the hiring process. To say, I can't control whether a company decides to hold 6 rounds of interviews coupled with unprofessional behavior (i.e. ghosting).

I had the same situation occur several weeks ago - was rejected after a 3rd round of interviews. The hiring manager sent me a personal email stating how much he enjoyed speaking with me, appreciated my qualifications and background, and that he'd like to keep the line of communication open. Also, he said he'd be willing to be a reference for me if needed. I felt so good at that point I almost forgot I was rejected.

,,Master_Mura,,,,,"My first job was rather well paid (logistician) but it was very mind numbing to me. I hated every day I went to work.

Then I went back to school at the age of 21, to finish high school. Now I work in IT and love it. It's been 3 years that I wasn't paid because I was in school and 3 more years that I was paid half of minimum wage because I was an apprentice and minimum wage doesn't apply to apprentices where I live.
I'm now 26 years old and my first full paycheck will come in july. It's a bit less than what I made as a logistician but I love my job. And I can only recommend you to chase happiness instead of money.

Of course, if you have children or other people who depend on you, make sure you can support them along the way. It would be bad if your family ends in poverty because of that. But if there are no children, go for it. Save as much money as possible until your school starts though. You'll need it."
,,coachzuzana,,,,,"It does seem you have to answer the fundamental issue within yourself. It seems like there are two needs that need to be met. Service to self and service to others - currently they seem to be clashing from what you are describing. I think it's also about the idea that you have about yourself. I think what is very important to realise is that you come here alone and you live here alone. If you are not first happy with yourself and be super clear about who you think you are and want to be and as a result of this you are unhappy because you are trying to fill in the void to absorb all the problems of the world just to be able to feel or address yourself self-worth this way - you may end up secretly hating yourself and not being happy for the rest of your like. If someone is not happy then people around them won't really be happy.

I on the other hand have been with more companies than they have their whole career and it just takes a good chat to let them know that things have changed. I don't have to stay in a job I hate and things are way more expensive now so if I don't see the next promotion coming then I'm out.

Things have changed, and its not uncommon for someone to be unhappy at work, even if they used to enjoy that kind of job. Nothing i say should change what you feel, and you decide whats best for your life. Having a job is important, especially now that covid, somepeople dont even have that. But if you want to take the risk to find a better job, even if it pays less, go for it. Humans are resilient, and you will still be able to survive if this falls through"

Honestly .. its a bit painful .. i mean i enjoy learning new stuff but its not that easy to do that in a new environment and while managing a whole different tasks and responsibilities .. 

So im telling you that because even though i thought of quitting now because i felt overwhelmed .. what really helped me is to get back to what i liked about this field and what attracted me to it in the first place .. and of course the support of few of my amazing friends who (even though tell me what i know already) help to reassure me that its gonna be rough at first but i just need to take it easy ... I love it and even if i change the company i still wanna do it .. 

There's so much potential now, the future of the healthcare industry is going to be different and requires from us to learn new skills ... You can explore new fields .. read about different projects .. try and learn some new skills ... It will never be time wasted i promise u 
As long as u dont torture yourself and know that ur family loves and support u .. take as much time as u need .. but dont take any haste decisions for a temp fix

70k Entry Level Salary for Consulting in San Francisco?,mjfacf,fskate10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/mjfacf/70k_entry_level_salary_for_consulting_in_san/,6,6,1617477724.0,
,,brokecollegekid69,,,,,What type of firm? 70 seems a bit low. Are you talking MBB or boutique firm and is this for a recent college grad or grad student?
,,StrangeMonk,,,,,"Well, I lived in SF on 17k a year once.  70K is comfortable.  You'll probably want to live with roommates on that salary, but it's still quite comfortable.  Of course, you should probably negotiate by collecting some data on comparable salaries (as listed on indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and propose a higher salary - assuming they will most likely only meet you halfway."
,,SF-guy83,,,,,"I‚Äôm in San Francisco. $70k is below average for professional roles, but not bad. Most people in San Francisco and surrounding suburbs have roommates. If moving to San Francisco, look for rent controlled apartments. Don‚Äôt live too far outside San Francisco as the commute could be bad and parking in downtown San Francisco is expensive. If your commuting to Silicon Valley, you need to do more research to see if you want to live in San Francisco or closer to work. They each offer very different experiences. 

Regarding the opportunity. If I read your post it sounds like a consulting role at a large company, not a consulting firm. If the company is a big name like Apple, Google, Salesforce, etc. then yes you should take it. But since it‚Äôs only 3 weeks PTO it‚Äôs probably not a tech company. Having these names on your resume will go a long way. If it‚Äôs a lesser known company, you need to do more research. What‚Äôs the upward mobility look like? Is it a public or private company? What‚Äôs their funding look like? Personally I think living in the Bay Area opens you up to a lot of companies. There are thousands of start ups and large companies that have headquarters or offices in the San Francisco Bay Area. After this job you will have lots of options for future work. 

Also consider the full compensation package. Sign on bonuses are not too common. Relocation really depends on the role and the type of company. Also consider, relocation is about $5k, so not significant. Total comp could include meals in the office, do you pay $200/month for medical/dental/vision or $0 out of your paycheck, gym membership, commuter expenses, free electric vehicle charging, etc. These all add up to expenses that you could pay out of pocket."
,,mlcarson,,,,,Think about it this way.   Why do you want to live like a college student with roommates in a city that can't even keep human feces off the street?   You could live a lot better life practically anywhere in the country.   There are only two worst places in the USA that I can think of for me and those would be NYC and DC.

,,JustJess234,,,,,"They‚Äôre supposed to help you plan your career path or help you find some kind of work or if your in college, internship. I briefly worked with one in college, but the jobs they suggested clashed with the class schedule. 
I need one because I‚Äôve been out of the workforce due to the pandemic and if there‚Äôs any kind of help or training they can give me to help me find work, I‚Äôll take it. I can‚Äôt reach my other job resources/networks and honestly, they are my last hope. And this one operates online, which helps me cause I have no transportation."
,,mlcarson,,,,,"They had a different name for people like that 30 years ago but they were just as useless then.   If you were somebody that didn't need help  - ie 3.5+ GPA and in a hot career field -- they could help hook you up with a job at a large company that they had contacts with.  These people could find work without their help though.  

Here's what I'd recommend.  Search the job advertisements via the Internet.  You really can't do anything about lack of job experience but you can teach yourself the skills that they are looking for (at least most of the time).   Customize your resume to the common job requirements.   Your research should show you what's in demand and what's not.   

Be prepared to MOVE if the jobs you are looking for aren't in your area.  With so many states still doing lockdowns -- go to a state that's not.  Apply for jobs in more rural areas if they exist where there's less competition. 

The professionals will tell you its all about networking.  There may be some truth in that but it used to be called the old-boy network and was frowned upon because you weren't making it on your own merits.      Find work in a large company if you can (even if it's not related to your education) since you'll be allowed to apply for unadvertised positions that come up within the company.   If you can't do that then just get a job somewhere even if it's delivering pizzas.   You're going to go into a downward spiral if you're not doing something."
,,JustJess234,,,,,"Moving costs a lot of money, heck of a lot more than the little I have saved up. I‚Äôm looking for work from home and remote for a reason, though also at local nonprofits and small businesses while trying to find work that makes me feel happy and fulfilling. One that pays enough for me to live off of, or multiple if necessary. 
Even if it were necessary, I‚Äôm not ready to take such a drastic step. Redecorating with what I have on hand and decluttering is one thing, but upending my roots and leaving before I‚Äôm ready to step out on my own? One of my uncles did this, he got kicked out of his house after losing his job and lives with my Grandma now. I‚Äôm not going to let that happen to me, the only way I‚Äôm leaving is when I know I can support myself financially or if I get married, whichever happens first.
And by the way, I am currently volunteering doing online data entry for museum archives and taking language and technology classes, all to expand my knowledge and learn new skills. I‚Äôm not doing nothing, I‚Äôm doing everything I can. And asking career experts for help isn‚Äôt a bad thing."
,,mlcarson,,,,,"And that's why people are without jobs.    You have to be willing to move where they are.  You don't move until you have a job.   If you don't have a lot, moving doesn't cost a lot.  If you're an older guy like myself doing a cross country move, it's very expensive.    I'll have to sell my house and either sell or move the contents.   Moving the contents really depends on what things are worth vs the cost to move them.   You can usually do better by hiring movers on both ends and using U-pak/Pods for transport rather than doing a full-service move.   Regional moves you can transport yourself via U-Haul -- always buy the vehicle insurance. 

My first move was just with whatever I could fit in my car.  Got an apartment and some furniture necessities (bed/couch/table) at the second hand store and that was it. 

I never volunteered my time just for experience. That time would be better spent at a minimum wage job or learning new skills.    Best of luck to you in your search."
,,JustJess234,,,,,"I CANT move! Weren‚Äôt you paying attention? There‚Äôs nowhere in the closest time zone where I can afford a place on minimum wage even with help and I lack transportation. Unless you‚Äôre going to give advice to someone trapped and landlocked in their hometown, don‚Äôt reply to me again."
,,mlcarson,,,,,"You don't move for a minimum wage job.  They're everywhere.  I was paying attention but just reject the premise.   Nobody is trapped or landlocked in their hometown.   It just might take a little longer to move.  If minimum wage is all you can get, get it -- drop the volunteer work.  Get two jobs if you can.  You earn as much as possible, bank what you can, until you do have the money to move.  And you don't limit yourself to the closest time zone. You go where work is.  

It sounds like you have multiple problems. 

1. Transportation -- get a car -- it's  a necessity almost everywhere.  You get the cheapest thing that will run reliably for a year or more.  That means a hoopty.  Most everybody has a car of some type by age 18 -- they're just not pretty.   
2. Cash -- bank enough for a move (1st/last mo rent + moving exp)
3. Skills  -- train yourself on whatever employers are looking for.
4. Openness to moving where the jobs are.
5. Attitude.  If your responses on here are anything like what your career coach experienced or how you interact with potential employers then you have an issue which the above won't fix.

Again, good luck!"
,,JustJess234,,,,,"First, I live near a major city. Second, I was saving for a car at my last job because public transportation sucks (I used to have a car in college but it broke down a lot and there were accidents, so my parents got rid of it. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm looking locally) Third, I don‚Äôt have a lot in the bank to cash out and saving the majority of what I earned is important to me. Finally, my coach is in the city and we telecommute, but the problem isn‚Äôt defensiveness, It‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt have a dream job in mind, I have no idea what I want to do job wise, all I know about work is what I learned at jobs and throughout my education, plus said volunteer experience. In fact, twice volunteering led me to jobs in retail and the library respectively. I took a physical/practical test in person during high school that also said I‚Äôd be suited for working in an office environment, but I don‚Äôt recall the exact details or what kind of office (medical? insurance? some kind of tech or fashion business?)

,,JustStranger6803,,,,,"why not wait until the pandemic is over when most of population is vaccinated. it looks like it might finally be better by this Fall. based on what you've posted, maybe some of the stress/anxiety/depression your family is facing is due to the pandemic. if your job has been a good constant in this turbulent time, I'd rather not risk leaving at this time, imo.

if you've already made up your mind about moving, just know that you won't know for sure if your new job will be a good fit or not, this is not in your control. at least you still have a job, so you have the luxury to decide to accept or decline the new job opportunities if you sense you won't like it."
,,Fixer145,,,,,"I appreciate the response. Unfortunately, pandemic aside, the want to move has been a long time coming, we were originally supposed to start moving a year ago, but we did decide to wait until the pandemic was over. (even though it's still got a while).

&#x200B;

You're right, the ball is in my court and i should probably be picky about the positions I apply and accept. I'm sure if I was more excited about the position, it wouldn't be a hard choice."
,,landacareer,,,,,"As u/JustStranger6803 mentioned, you currently have a job so it takes some of that stress away. I would recommend doing your research on a company that aligns with your goals and what you are looking for as far as culture and flexibility. Positions are starting to open up so more opportunities will present themselves.

As far as your current position, I would personally refrain from pushing remote since they have already addressed it as you don't want them to start looking for your possible replacement if they know you are looking to leave. Not that this will happen but just beware of it, as they too need to cover themselves. 

Leaving a company is always a risk, follow your gut and do your research. If a position doesn't feel right then pass on it, you can always interview and find out more information. If anything it is an opportunity to practice interviewing so you can ACE the interview for the job that you will be excited about. 

Best of luck!"
,,Fixer145,,,,,"Thank you! I agree - I think pushing the working remote would be a bad idea. 

I'm not sure why, I get a feeling that the next company can't be, 'as good' or will be a bad fit since I work in IT.

You could study the physiological/forensic aspects of death. You could explore death in creative ways - nonfiction pieces, short stories, graphic works, etc. You could become involved in online areas where people explore death in healthy ways.

,,E_D_Psychologist,,,,,"You clearly demonstrate that you have a passion and natural talent for coaching - bringing out the best in others. As such, I am not surprised that your current work environment is actually having a substantial influence on how you feel about your career and life - because, for you, career is probably something that is truly meaningful for you in your life. 

Don't let your circumstances derail you from your passion! I had a similar experience when I started out doing therapy years ago at an institution where it tapped all my inner resources, hitting burnout from lack of support and misalignment between me and the values of the institution. But, when I finally entered an environment which was conducive and supportive, my whole perception and expereince of therapy changed! So, I would advise you to go back to your core - what are you really passionate about? what gives you meaning? what makes you excited about starting your day? If you do not have the answers, think what WOULD create that for you. 

Another option is to consider doing a strengths assessment or personality profiling to see where your talents lie, and to help you determine what type of environment/career would fit with your personality. Self-awareness goes a very long way when your views have been clouded by external factors. 

I know you feel disheartened at this point, but there is hope! Life has a way of pushing you to a point where change is the only option! Start thinking about yourself, you will be a better person for everyone around you if you are fulfilled within. The club will go on - I promise - everyone is replaceable, as horrible as that sounds."

In my opinion being alone vs in a relationship/with a family doesn‚Äôt change those thoughts a lot. I have a gf and a family that wants to see me often but I still wonder why I wake up at 7AM every day just to go clock in for a corporation.

As far as being a bachelor goes you have hope! Once coronavirus is not as rampant and people are frequenting bars, restaurants and such again, I highly encourage you just get yourself out there more! It‚Äôs something that people always said to me but the older I get the more I realize it‚Äôs true: there‚Äôs someone out there for everyone. In your case it may just be a matter of finding them. Know your worth and shoot your shot, even if you have to take a ton of them. Keep your confidence as you wade through the BS and you‚Äôll get there."
Careers based on work put in. NO SALARIES!,k11ahu,hulakamachaman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/k11ahu/careers_based_on_work_put_in_no_salaries/,4,4,1606339632.0,
,,gbdallin,,,,,"Construction, you're doing the right kind of work, pays what's called piece rate. Meaning if you're doing siding, you get paid according to how much you actually put on the wall. Entry level guys usually get an hourly rate until they know the work flow. 

Sales. Car sales especially, though I'm willing to bet real estate is a good one too. If you've got a degree in finance, you can use that to get into ""advanced"" sales positions. If you're at a car dealership, for example, there's usually the car salesmen, that get the deal going, and then there's the ""finance guy"" who is actually also a salesman, but you'd be working on things like extended warranties and other stuff where showing a spreadsheet for costs, etc can be a real money generator. 

Bartender. Look dude I know you're a server and you probably hear this a lot, but bartenders make double what you're making and it's frankly about the same as far as workload."
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"At the risk of putting it bluntly, if your ultimate goal is to have you're own business (as a DJ) then you're going to NEED to do sales - that will be the way you build up your business, especially when you start out.

So maybe think about something which would give you the sales skills which you can then transfer across to your business."
,,hulakamachaman,,,,,"I do understand what you‚Äôre saying. However, when I think of sales I think of cold calling and getting someone to buy something they don‚Äôt need. In the realm of booking gigs its a lot different. They come from a result of networking, referrals and seeing me perform at clubs/bars. Also selling someone on a service I know I‚Äôm good at and something that I genuinely care about is different then trying to sell a car to someone that in actuality shouldn‚Äôt probably taking out credit to buy a car...

Yet, I do see the merit in building my sales skills. Any suggestions for specific industry to look into?"
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"I don't know about a specific industry but you're right to hone in on skills.  So I'd look at the question this way - what skills will you need for your DJ business?  Not just the performing, but things that you've identified, like networking and winning referrals, and also skills on the business side - cash flow, basic accounting - all the other stuff you need to think about.  Then figure out how you can build up those skills.  Some of it will be through a job, others you can pick up via courses on things like Udemy.

Also, what are you doing or can you do now to promote your DJ business?  Can you do things like online discos?  YouTube videos like ""The three/five/ten things you need to ask before you book a DJ for your wedding""?"

,,mycatisacunt____,,,,,This happened to me a month ago and I took it
,,CoachMiinkay,,,,,"That's annoying to be told you're a good fit but we don't want you unless there's someone better. WTF. RUDE. 

On the other hand, they want you enough to offer you another job which is kind of a plus. I know sales at your current job was not what you wanted, but maybe take a non-judgmental approach to this new offer. Really get to know what its about before you write it off. What are you selling? Do you get to decide how to sell it? Can you get behind the what you're selling? Can you sell with integrity? 

Sales can be really underhand. But there's also a way sales can be really positive. If you're selling something you believe in and your sale is helping the receiver move a head faster then its a positive thing. 

As an entrepreneur, I had to learn how to be look at my products being worth it and helpful to people. If someone didn't buy my products they might not get to their goal faster. So its a win-win for both of us if I can sell my products. I definitely tell people, this isn't gonna help you if... so that people don't waste their money. I only want to sell to people it will actually help. 

Job offers don't come every day, so I think try to be open minded about what this is before you make a decision. I know it'll be hard to put your bad experiences behind you but an open door is always worth looking into."
,,DaniloIce,,,,,That's what I thought. I believe that they don't even have the budget to recruit the type of profile they're looking for.
,,DaniloIce,,,,,"Good to know, thanks for the reply"
,,DaniloIce,,,,,"Really appreciate your response, thanks a lot. I'll stay open minded and see what they have to offer, they seem to be a great organisation. Though because it's a senior position, there's definitely an impostor syndrome lurking and the fact they're not convinced I can do it because I'm junior doesn't help. Anyway, I'll think and see how it pans out!"
What does a 4 hour interview entail?,jmw2pg,daydaylin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/jmw2pg/what_does_a_4_hour_interview_entail/,7,8,1604350819.0,
,,L1tost,,,,,"As an engineer, I had a 3 hour in person interview before starting to work for my current company. The way they set it up was 6 one-on-one 30-minute interviews with different staff (mostly engineers or engineering managers with an HR rep and the VP sprinkled in). Yours could be similar, or it could also be a panel of interviewers that each ask questions in turn instead. Most of my questions were general engineering problems (most of which I didn‚Äôt completely solve btw), but they wanted to see how I thought out each problem and what I did when I ran into an issue. 

If I were you I would ask friends who are also motion designers what kinds of interview questions they have received, or try to google possible questions. Of course there will also likely be the typical questions like ‚Äúwhy do you want to work for us?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs an example of a project you struggled with and how did you fix it?‚Äù, etc."
,,Comprehensive_Set,,,,,"4 hours, is pretty standard if it's a ""super-day"" or a full-day of interviewing. Generally it's 

1. hiring manager interview 
2.  1 or 2  co-workers interviewing you 
3. hour of lunch - team will take you out 
4. 30 minute recruiter close"
,,kateye389,,,,,"We often do half to full day interviews in my job and it's usually a number of 1 hour interviews with various people in different roles, and sometimes lunch."
,,daydaylin,,,,,Thanks! Kind of strange how they don't do it all at once? Lol
,,daydaylin,,,,,I see...thank you!
,,daydaylin,,,,,Thanks for the help :)
,,L1tost,,,,,"Well, coming from the other side now, these are typical business-as-usual days for everyone working at the company, so pulling them out of their normal workday for four hours every time they need to interview someone can be a major time sink. Pulling someone out for half an hour is much more reasonable (and easier on HR, who‚Äôs doing all the scheduling)"
Where can I find machine learning internships for high school students?,j7fl1p,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/j7fl1p/where_can_i_find_machine_learning_internships_for/,6,1,1602172457.0,
,,IncoherentPenguin,,,,,"Okay first let me say I admire your desire to learn more about machine learning. It‚Äôs certainly going to be a pretty fast growing segment of computer science for the near future at least. Also you have clearly dedicated a lot of time and effort to getting as far as you have gotten. Very impressive work.

Now the bad news, to truly understand machine learning you need to understand some higher level math. I‚Äôm not familiar with what they teach these days in high school but I‚Äôm fairly certain graph theory isn‚Äôt going to be part of the curriculum. So your understanding of what‚Äôs really going on is going to be minimal. 

That said most AI companies aren‚Äôt going to hire an intern that‚Äôs not even left high school. True AI learning happens during the last couple of years in university and in some universities not even then. You need to be accepted to a masters program. So despite your knowledge it‚Äôs not likely that you will be hired anywhere. I‚Äôm really sorry about that. Honestly given your drive and ambition I think a company would be stupid not to give you a chance.

Okay now for some good news, you said you‚Äôd be even willing to do it for free if you got to learn more. There are literally thousands and thousands of open source projects that could use someone as committed and driven as you are. So check around I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find someone. If not circle back and I‚Äôll see if I can find something for you."

What comes naturally to you? What do other people compliment you on? Maybe you have a great eye for detail. Maybe you‚Äôre a great communicator. Maybe you love cars. 

If you build what you do as a ‚Äòjob‚Äô around your skills and passions, then you can‚Äôt really fail. Loving what you do is the absolute key to success in life. Figuring this out is what makes life fun."
,,,,,,,"In my opinion, the three questions you need to ask are:

- what am I interested in?
- what could I be good at?
- what jobs are (or will be) in demand?

The best jobs for you should touch on the answers to each of those three questions. Obviously there is more to it than that, but that‚Äôs a good starting point. 

The first question can be the most difficult to answer, so just don‚Äôt be afraid to try things and take chances."

,,itsfrankgrimesyo,,,,,"Apply to a university even if you haven‚Äôt figured it out. Most undergrads don‚Äôt require a major until year two.

,,rbwheat,,,,,"Hi milkyman_69.... really??? ... and your 16 lol....

The big picture for you - get good grades in high school first and get an after school job. You‚Äôll learn real quick what you don‚Äôt want to do the rest of your life. Next avoid getting anyone pregnant or getting pregnant until you can actually afford it. Bottom line, make really good life decisions for yourself.

Making good decisions keep your options wide open. 

Go to college, away from home if your parents can help. If there is a money issue at home go to school locally. Finish within 5 years. Get a degree that you can use to earn a good income. Let greed help you make that decision. Find out what jobs pay the most and Taylor your education to get you there.

After you graduate college you‚Äôll have a good foundation to do anything you like. 

There may not be a single dream job. It‚Äôs likely there are just a continuous evolution of learning new skills and applying them in a new setting. Just continue to make good life decisions especially what to do with your income. 

Don‚Äôt blow it on toys!!!! Make your money earn additional income and you have power to to anything. 

You will likely have a long life, plan for long term. No job or opportunity lasts more than several years. Learn to adapt.

Best of luck!!"

I would encourage you to talk to people, to find out about their jobs, to see if it sounds interesting to you or if it sounds like something you need to pass on.  I‚Äôm happy to give you tips on reaching out to people. 

Also, are there counsellors in your school with whom you can speak?  It‚Äôs their job to help you along with this. 

Finally, you said you didn‚Äôt do well at physics.  I‚Äôd encourage you not to give up.  You‚Äôre very young, and still learning to learn and study. 

Finally, as others said, it‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt have all the answers now. Even though it‚Äôs understandable that you want them.  

Do you want to go to university? Or a trade school? Or travel? Or volunteer?

Also, do you have a sense of the adult life you‚Äôll like to have?

Good luck!"
What Career options are there if Engineering isn't for me?,ip4ise,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/ip4ise/what_career_options_are_there_if_engineering_isnt/,5,2,1599607132.0,
,,nebula_2k,,,,,"I myself am a student (mechanical engineering) so I may be wrong, but i think companies hire analysts and consultants in their respective fields. So having a degree in business/finance may help you land a job at such company. Not sure about the courses you can pursue though. It will also depend on your region and the job opportunities there."
,,relaci,,,,,"If you want to be actively involved in the problem solving, then your easiest path into that career would be through an engineering program.  If you don't believe that you are capable of completing such a program, I would advise you adjust your expectations and choose a role where you could be tangentially contributory.  Look at your current strengths and determine if you could facilitate communication between the change-makers and the customers through a role in sales, or explore pathways that would allow you to work more on public policy on these issues through a degree in architecture, marketing, or political science.  

There is no easy field of study or career path that will lead you to being able to affect change though.  All of the pathways involved are difficult in their own ways.  If math isn't your thing, but you're good at logic and interpersonal communication, I'd focus on that direction.  Alternatively, if you're not the best communicator but you're great at visualizations of concepts, that would be something to focus on.  The trick is discovering what your strengths are and using those to determine how to get you from here to where you want to be, and you seem to have the where you want to be part figured out.  That's usually the hard part.  So look into pathways that get you to a place where you can improve the infrastructure and/or environment based on what you excell at.

As an example, I have a friend who majored in architecture and now he works at the city planning department.  I have another friend who majored in marine biology who is working on storm water run-off capture of debris.  A couple of my friends majored in political science and are working in the capital on policies to facilitate the expansion of these types of projects through governmental policy.  You could major in a foreign language and become an interpreter for global conferences in these topics.  It really doesn't matter what you major in, or what specific role you develop into, because all of these roles matter in improving these situations.  

As much hate as is thrown around about lobbyists, I had the opportunity to have a discussion with a group of clean water lobbyists one evening, and I greatly admire the work they do.  Maybe that is a career path you could look into!  

Three questions: What do you want to achieve in life, and what are your strengths right now, and what do you feel you could improve on greatly with the right training?

Three answers: Do that, major in that, and take most of your electives in that."

,,,,,,,"Look at the options of work that your qualifications would allow you to get into... For example, financial advisor/coach. 

Look at the different layers beyond the current norms. That generally will open things up. Ask yourself, what do you want? Do you want to sit at desk from 8 to 5 or do you want another kind of challenge? Once that is answered then you can move on from there.

,,DrJonTam,,,,,"It sounds like the main thing you're struggling with is you don't have clarity on what you want to do for your career. I help people gain career clarity for my work and when you're in your 20s, this is totally normal.

The best thing to do if you're not sure is to experiment and get a taste for different lines of work so you gain a deeper self-awareness of who you are, what the workforce is like, and how it's like to work with a range of personalities, cultures, and backgrounds.

Through this process, try to figure out your interest, skills, lifestyle preferences, values, and personality on top of the market trends in fields that pique your interest. Luck will play a factor too, the community you're in will matter a lot (especially if you end up in a toxic situation or meet a great mentor).

Of all of the above, your personality is probably the most important since that determines the nature of the work that you'll be doing. Even when companies hire for entry-level positions, they hire first for ""fit"" (personality, can you get along with everyone else), then ""skill"" (can you do it), then ""experience"" (have you done it before) - usually in that order. 

Personality also largely affects what kind of jobs are suited for you. For example, if you're really introverted, you'll be hard-pressed in a sales role that requires constant socializing.

I have a PDF where I outline the steps on finding your ideal career. Check it out [here](http://idealcareer.drjontam.com/).

You can also take a quick and free personality test [here](https://drjontamquiz.herokuapp.com/) that's quite psychometrically accurate and focuses on what characteristics in work are a fit for you.

,,Vegetable_Sufficient,,,,,"Learning on the job as a processor is a great way to get started. You'll begin to understand what documentation is needed to determine credit worthiness. Familiarizing yourself with income, debt, and credit requirements and documentation is step one. Each lender has different processes and/or nuances, but familiarize yourself with the types of  loan programs and the regulations/guidelines of each. A lot of mortgage companies will have databases with educational materials on stuff like: income calculations, DTI requirements, large deposit rules, etc. Like I said, guidelines may vary slightly from lender to lender, but a lot of the basics are the same. To get a general education that can be applied at any mortgage lender, you can use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac resources to educate yourself.

You might be interested in the effective altruism movement (r/effectivealtruism)  - they would basically answer your question with ""yes, it is morally wrong"" and they have a lot of theories about how to make the most impact with your career. (Although one of their big answers seems to be just to make a lot of money and donate it to the most effective charities, which seems like kind of a disappointing conclusion to come to.) But to answer yes to that question is to hold yourself to very different standards than most people.

There are plenty of blatantly evil jobs are morally wrong, but I don't think all jobs that don't solve the world's biggest problems are morally wrong. But is it morally better to have a job that helps people? Yeah, probably. Either way, there is evidence that people find their careers more meaningful when they feel they are helping people, so that would be something  for you to consider."

You could also work a job that provides for a family, and your child could be the next albert einstein or martin luther king jr.  So keep in mind you can have great impact on the world in ways other than career.

That being said, I worked multiple jobs in a career that is focused on extracting resources from the earth and damaging the environment, and knew I could never support such an industry.  You'll eventually find out that morally good careers rarely pay well, whereas ambiguous or evil careers pay the best.  Hopefully that changes in the future!  If you work a career that isn't harming people or the planet (and keep in mind even very innocuous industries are,) and you use your earnings and talents to help the world in other ways, I think you are helping society."
,,purposefullseed,,,,,"The book The Purpose Path, by Dr. Nicholas Pearce, is about finding work or a vocation that is in line with your purpose or who you are.  Whatever that is, it just has to work for you. Within that, most people do aim to find meaning and while it may not impact the world at large, their work may allow them to have an impact in their own world, city or community.  Do what you love, be great at it, somebody will pay you for it, because you'll do it better than anyone else. Find work aligned with your purpose where your ""role is aligned with your soul,"" per Dr. Pearce. That will lead you to fulfillment. No harm in that at all. The harm is not seeking that at all, and meandering through work like a zombie.

Sometimes we can do that alone, find work aligned with our purpose.  When we can't this is a place where a purpose/career coach like myself can help.  If interested, send me a note.

I want to switch to CS (AI in particular) and start my career in Canada. Is there any experience or advice you would have for me?,gss1i8,R-_-D,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/gss1i8/i_want_to_switch_to_cs_ai_in_particular_and_start/,6,2,1590755152.0,
,,,,,,,"Get a job as soon as you can and start saving money, paying off debts, and investing.

If you want to work in the AI industry start by spending 30 minutes a day  every day taking online courses, reading books, and eventually working on a project.

As I said, start with 30 minutes a day just to get started, then work towards doing 2+ hours if you have the time for it.

Stay away from distractions like drugs, video games, etc, so that you can increase your daily productivity as much as possible so that you have more time to learn your desired skill.

Depending upon how disciplined you are it will probably take you 3+ years to get into an entry level AI job assuming that you have no experience with coding.

Not having a degree in CS or AI is going to be a bit of a entry barrier to you switching careers but once you have completed a few projects to show off your skills and then get a few years of work experience under your belt you will be in the same league as your collegues.

Follinwg this path may seem less certain and more difficult than just getting your masters in CS and then getting a job- but losing out in 2 years salary while also going into debt over a masters degree is going to put you in a financial whole that is going to cause you stress later on.

Also having ANY work experience, even in engineering- is going to make you a more attractive applicant to an AI company  so long as you have the qualificaitions to work there and can show that you have been working dilligently towards educating yourself in the field of AI.

You may not want to work in nuclear engineering long term but you just spent four years of your life educating yourself to do so- do not waste that investment by abandonding that course now.

I do not know how much money you can/will as a Nuc Eng, but I would bet that if you became employed this year you could put $20k in the bank bare minimum by the time you would have been done with your CS masters,  which would have cost you a similar amount- so at the very least you will have spent $30-40k getting your CS masters all the while you could end up with the same job oppurtunities that you would have had if you had just gotten a job and learned AI in your own time.

Doing an online MS or nighttime classes is something worth looking into- but whatever you do I would try to find employment ASAP. Having your dream job is a privilege and a blessing and it is something worth pursuing- but not at the cost of your immeadiate financial well being and potential career oppurtunities."

>You may not want to work in nuclear engineering long term but you just spent four years of your life educating yourself to do so- do not waste that investment by abandonding that course now.

I had been meaning to do that. I (22M) graduated last year (in July) and have been looking for a job since (first 3 months in the UK). Nuclear engineering is a field that varies drastically in different countries. The government operates the industry in the country (India) I live in. And they just care about testing you. Also, the pay is not very good. If I want to work in any other country, the laws make it difficult. Because most of the companies also work in defence and they need a citizen of that country. Reduces the available roles. My plan had been to work in the field for a few years to get some financial stability and then pursue other fields of interest. However, the low wage for entry-level jobs in my country and limited roles have put me in a difficult position. 
That being said, due to Covid-19 most of the mechanical engineering jobs have taken a hit. On the other hand, nuclear seems to be stable if not growing. Now I am wondering if I should spend more time looking for a role in the industry. What do you think?

> all the while you could end up with the same job oppurtunities that you would have had if you had just gotten a job and learned AI in your own time.

This does sound like a good plan. I am an international though, so wouldn't it be difficult to get a job in Canada without physically being there?

> Having your dream job is a privilege and a blessing and it is something worth pursuing- but not at the cost of your immeadiate financial well being and potential career oppurtunities.

I cannot agree more. It is important to consider the financial well being. It is playing an important role in my decision-making process.

I think your sister can still complete the assignment without giving away anything, she just has to be careful about what she says.

Much Closer to the beach although I must admit I don‚Äôt live that far away now and I don‚Äôt really go to it often.

Biking is safer mostly

No state income tax

No state inspection for vehicle

It‚Äôs Florida I mean there‚Äôs a lot here obviously

I don‚Äôt have a job in VA so that‚Äôs not holding me back

My mom would be happy

My grandparents would have help

I speak Spanish and many people in Florida do as well

Cons

There are two rooms in my current house which I‚Äôve leased out to college students for august(I lease them out every year but the previous tenants left already because of covid).  I think I should be at the house for them, but idk.

While I don‚Äôt really have friends.  I have a couple people who I talk to and hang out with who live in VA and also my family lives 30 minutes away from me in VA.  I‚Äôm terrible at meeting new people.  I‚Äôve not had a gf since high school.

Living with your grandparents is not a great talking point

I say this not to pat myself on the back, but to illustrate how important and effective a good combination of degrees and skills can be. It is all about how you spin what you have done. 

So, with a BA in philosophy and a minor in business, you can do quite a bit. You can get jobs in the business files if you have the right internships. You can do nonprofit work if you get some nonprofit/ solid volunteer work done. The possibilities are endless, but make sure you get some effective experience outside of the classroom.

Yes, it's still young, but you should at least have enough life experience to narrow things down. I'm not sure *anything* can help these people, because it comes down to an unwillingness to help themselves.

However, a lot of people get stuck in an (arguably more common) position where their original aspirations didn't pan out and they are now at a loss. I started in the military after high school, which I thought I would make a career of, hated it, and ended up going back to school and have worked some jobs that I ended up really liking, despite not considering them in high school. I've since changed careers *again* and am now working for a government organization (although that is on hold due to the pandemic).

You can't prepare for the latter scenario, where initial career plans aren't what you thought they'd be, you just have to shift trajectory, and in doing so, you're going to have some uncertainty and will have to do some soul-searching. 

It should also be mentioned that a lot of high schoolers, and the high school ""guidance counselors"" that advise them, have an inherently limited worldview, which limits the career paths that high schoolers see as potential options. A lot of career pickers are basically: work in the public service, work for a private company doing business or tech work, do a trade, etc. like some sort of kindergarten book of workers and their jobs. They are too general and ignore the nuances of each career path (choosing a generic job title like ""police officer"" or ""scientist"" or ""engineer"" or ""doctor"" drastically underestimates the relative challenge and complexity of each profession and career path). The reality is that a lot of people end up working in non-traditional career paths, that aren't indexed by a lot of tools and can't be accurately planned for, so in some ways, making it up as you go is a necessity for some industries. Having a life plan is important, but so is flexibility."

Yes, but also so that people are aware that the career paths are more than the career title. For instance, chemical engineers do very little chemistry, and ""biotech engineers"" (never heard of it tbh) or biomedical engineers do no biotechnology work; that field of work is still almost completely dominated by specialized MDs or biochemists. BMEs do more bionics, whereas biotechnology usually refers to microscale stuff like assay development, but that is probably lost on a lot of jobseekers anyways.

> learn software engineering on my own or by doing a bachelor's for 4 years?

The term software engineer (as a non-colloquialism or superfluous job title) describes a specific area of programming that, I'd argue, is a lot more difficult to teach yourself than simply programming. SWEs typically deal with algorithm improvement, improving data processing pipelines, and sometimes working with computer and electrical engineers to get parameters for application-specific hardware, alongside traditional programming stuff like data cleaning and debugging. I'd wager that 50% of ""software engineers"" on the internet do not actually do that, but that's sort of semantics, because there are now wordpress ""developers"" who claim they are ""software engineers.""

""Engineer"" is a protected title in some areas, so you may want to investigate whether self-education is even an option.

> But my guess is 80-120k?

That could be right or wrong, depending on your use of the term. A self-taught programmer, doing web dev, in the current job market, could earn in that range eventually, but would definitely not start there. An accredited electrical or software engineer with some actual expertise that they went to school for and an internship, could be pulling that after a only few years in the field or even immediately out of school. A lot of this depends on location too.

> Does money matter?

Not until you don't have any.

This decision will have to be your own, since dropping out of med school for an alternative career path will objectively never make sense. Certain medical specialties are the top earning professions in the US. Then again, some specialties are also undergoing minor unemployment crises at the moment.

> mainly based on cramming all the info and guidelines 

You will likely disappointed with formal education in most fields, since this is pretty much what school is for engineers and software developers too. There are lots of interesting, arguably ""creative"" aspects to software development, but those aren't the aspects you're taught in school. School teaches the math, the interesting stuff you teach yourself."
,,LawrenceHugh70,,,,,I‚Äôd stick with medicine and see where you want to go from there. It‚Äôs good to not quit things. Your MD is just one degree. You could get another degree in something else after.
,,bayan963,,,,,"Okay so I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I have two medical specialists in my family who went through this same struggle, but still feel like they made the right choice becoming doctors. My dad was almost in the same situation as you are in now, went to med school because that's what his parents wanted, he didn't like it much but he pulled through and got good grades because he was also smart and could cram, he said he didn't find his passion in medicine until he specialized in Ophthalmology, he's been a specialist for over 30 years now and he's happy with his decision, it didn't make him big bucks at first cause he had to work to get recognized in the country, but now he's thrived, has his own practice and gets to work and make time for his family and everything else he wants. 

My sister recently finished specializing in general surgery, she found her passion in it, she can't imagine standing working in medicine if she specialized in anything else. 

My point here is, it's definitely a better choice when it comes to financial security now and later along the way, you could see what you enjoy the most specialty wise and go for that, you won't have to dabble much with other specialties once you start working in your specialty so it'll definitely be interesting. Medicine has tons of specialties and sub specialties these days that could cater to various interests, since you made it this far, it might be worth continuing a few years of clinical education to make it to that time when you'd be working with what you find interesting and challenging

Both my dad and my sister have great analytical skills and would have been great engineers too in my opinion. Personally I think that's a sign of having what it takes to become a doctor, along with the ability to deal with people respectfully and help them understand the complicated terms and conditions by simplifying them to their level of understanding

That said, you should so some soul searching and consult some people whose opinion you trust to help you decide. It's a big decision, don't quit on it just based on the financial aspect or what you think your dream job might be. Give it some time, it's never too late to go back to school and study engineering if you don't like what you experience later on, just give this career a shot first before you give up on it

Sorry for the long comment and best of luck"

However i would like to ask you one more question:
Do you feel bored with your work? (Like does it happen with every job regardless of your like/dislike). Because I assume that there is a ladder of posts and promotions in corporate work while working as an engineer. But doctors reach an early plateu of high income and minimal growth afterwards."
,,rasengan37,,,,,"Thanks for your reply. Yes, I will get the degree this year. I am thinking about what to do next. I can apply for a residency program, such as in Internal Medicine or Family Medicine, which will take another 3 years.

So now I am stuck between 'going with the flow' and 'trying something new and risky'"

,,,,,,,"Couldn't tell you, I currently work for the government doing neither software engineering nor medicine. My work is software related, but I wouldn't call it software engineering, by any means.

In general, the tech industry is interesting relative to science, simply because there is a lot of development going on over the past few years (I did a biochem degree first). It is genuinely impressive how quickly tech companies have evolved. However, this is very dependent on the health of the economy and outside investment, as we're currently seeing, so don't take anything as a guarantee."
,,,,,,,"Have you considered being a pathologist? Any doctor will see lots of mundane cases. Really that‚Äôs any field period.

Pathology you‚Äôll run into some brain teasers for sure (of course with lots of routine stuff)."
,,LawrenceHugh70,,,,,"I think you would find that something like being an engineer is just as rigid and uninteresting as medicine.

If you want to deal with abstract ideas and solving cool math and physics problems, you probably just want to be a professor.

If you have to do residency to become a doctor, you might as well do it and you‚Äôll only be like 28. 

Then you can go get some PhD and have fun being an academic. You could probably work part time too if you go into primary care."

Well done on taking action.  Speaking to your own financial advisor is a smart move.

You could also try contacting other financial advisors.  Have a look on LinkedIn  and, in particular, see if you can find some who changed careers, as you are contemplating.  Heck, you may even find some who changed from the same career as you.

,,chrissycm,,,,,"It could be, but it also could not be.

Any job isnt just looking for a qualified candidate, but also one that will mesh well with the team (a huge part of hidden discriminations, but that is another topic.) Also depending on what you are looking at doing, expressing enthusiasm can make a huge difference in your actual execution. This is where that ""could it be an excuse"" comes in. It may be read as a ""We doubt your ability to mesh with the team"" - but that is one scenario. 

My job is in customer service. Not everyone hired is a bubbly big personality love-people kind of person... but we have a higher percentage of them.than the average population for sure. There is actual job-skill related.  Who is going to hop in front of the counter and help the customers first - we want them. Who is going to look for solutions when a customer is being a Karen and turn their attitude around - we want them. Who is going to be able to be on their feet for 8+ hrs and still smiling and laughing - we want them. Someone who comes into the interview and has some technical skill and experience might not be selected if they seem too withdrawn or low energy. It takes 3 months before you even start being useful, and ingesting in someone who doesn't click is a risky move. Someone who seems like they need a job, is willing to work, but doesn't want to fight for a career - they often quit before those 3 months are over. (My job looks entry level, but the people who stay are people who want to move up into management or make a career out of it - people looking for a ""job"" can find an easier one for the same pay and usually do.)  

I almost didn't get my job when I first started for that reason. My efforts to be professional came across as withdrawn. My awkwardness at the interview made them doubt my longevity, and to be fair - I didn't know what I was applying for, so bad on me.  But my technical skills caused the assistant manager to push for me against the other candidates and they gave me a chance. I learned a lot and now come across with much more passion - but even then, my lack of ""hunger"" holds me back a lot. Do I want a promotion? ""Well yes, but I am not 100% so I'm not fighting for it."" - Means I don't get it. The moment I am ready to fight for it, I will get it, and I know it. The fight is exactly the skill they are waiting for me to develop.

Tip: Practice arrogance. Most of us are awkward with self-promotion.  It feels yucky, and we know our weaknesses too well. If you go in with ""integrity"" (translation: being honest about your flaws and providing them without prompting) you will often come across as not really wanting the job, and convincing them they don't want you. If you go in with ""modesty"" (translation: not bragging up little things) then you will come across as lacking enthusiasm. Pretend you are in 3rd grade and you get an award for everything. Brag about every ""award"". Play up team efforts as something you had a big part in. They are bigger than you think, what is easy for you and ""not a big deal"" are often the things that make you good at your job. If it seems silly to brag about them, brag anyway. (Note: professional bragging of course.)"
,,gingereng,,,,,"Just interviewed two candidates this week for the same position.

Masters of Economics vs MBA,en4r8y,randallparkinsons,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/en4r8y/masters_of_economics_vs_mba/,5,7,1578729684.0,
,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"Hi - I have a PhD in applied econ and taught at two small schools in the US for three years. I currently work in risk management at a large bank.

A masters in econ is much more employable in general at higher salaries. There is a glut of MBAs with no work exp. An MBA really is tailored towards a non business person that wants to learn business.

A masters in econ will hit you hard with statistics and math. If you do well, you can be a data scientist or a quantitative analyst.

I have a low opinion of the value per dollar of most MBA programs. At Harvad they take people that were already going to be successful and claim credit. It is difficult to learn econometrics but if you do, you will be set apart from others."
,,LawrenceHugh70,,,,,"Consider a masters in finance if you want to make money. My friend did it at Fordham in NYC, which is a good place to be if you want to make money."
,,randallparkinsons,,,,,"This is extremely helpful. Thank you. Couple follow-up questions:

1. You like your job? 
2. American schools vs European Schools? Which are better for econ and do they have different advantages?
3. I feel that if I have been out of school for a while it might be harder to get into a Masters for Econ because they are more academia oriented. Is this a problem?"
,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"1. No, but thats not because of the job, thats a long story. I like the field but this particular department has extremely poor management. I liked the same job at a previous bank. I'd say the working environment is VERY pro family though. No one really cares, which is one of the reasons I dislike this place, but it also has its benefits.

2. All that matters is econometrics and statistics. I know an American that found the only PhD Econ program in the world that doesn't require math, and he found it in France. Don't be that guy. He is a rich kid. So, it doesn't really matter Europe vs America IMO but if you want to come and live in America, then it has to be America.

You should aim for academia as a default. It is a good idea because it gives you something to aim for, but always keep your resume updated and leave at the first job offer. PhD is only worth it if you want to be an academic, and even then its not really worth it financially.

In general, MBA and MS econ are vastly different in econ. With MS in Econ you will have to learn something like R and probably should learn Python too. Honestly thats why MS econ is useful, plus Economists are the best staticians (I will defend that statement to the end). Without the understanding of economic theory, it is easy to make incorrect statistical models. 

I'd just say in general don't be intimidated and expect to have the hardest time of your life. But the harder it is, the less competition you will have when you get out. If you can do basic calculus and algebra, combined with some limited R type coding, you should be fine."
,,randallparkinsons,,,,,"1. i hope you find a better bank sometime soon. It sucks when you are stuck with a position with bad management, but sometimes i guess thats how it is. 
2. Very interesting. Yes, that was one of my main concerns that European universities would be less econometric and stats heavy. On the university ranking websites it says that most of the top econ schools is in the U.S. so I'm considering applying there, but theres much less tuition in Europe and I already speak german. Not sure whats the call there. 
3. Got it. Very interesting.

I don't know your field and don't live in your country, so that's just my two cents and hopefully that's somewhat useful. The PT job with a 100 mile round trip sounds like a bust to be honest.

First thing I started to think about was what I enjoyed. I think the next step is to think about what you are good at and develope a list of skills that you gained while on the job. You want to find skills that are transferable to the path you want to take.

One thing you might want to look at are online certifications. With how difficult it is to balance work and school as an adult without aid there seems to be a growing demand for online courses.

Your job is to explore and learn more about what you enjoy doing.  Your number one job in life is to do what brings you the greatest level of happiness.  

There are a few free tools that will help you to learn more about yourself and what you value.  I would recommend the free online personality test.  The 16 personalities one is good.  Then do the Dr John Demartini Values Determination test.  

Also look up ‚Äò27 Questions to find your passion‚Äô by Scott Dinsmore (live your legend) it is a free PDF that can be a very helpful tool.  I recommend that you ask friends and family to help you answer question 4 . What are you ridiculously good at? What are your precious gifts?  I find this is a hard one to answer with out input.

The other thing that can help is to do a few of the inexpensive courses on Udemy in things that you think you might be interested in... Such as jewellery design/ other design courses  - there are so many great courses at very cheap prices - if you enjoy the short online courses - you might just find the area that interests you the most.  

Give yourself time to explore your interests, skills and talents. Enjoy exploring until you discover the work that you look forward to doing.   All the best and remember to have fun and take the pressure off yourself."

,,HardenedLicorice,,,,,"You simply are the sum of your past experiences. Even seemingly small things can have a huge impact on how your character, demeanor, sense of justice, ease of opening up to others etc. is formed. There is no ""right way"".

It might help to think of you as a person in video game terms. You have dynamic bars not just for health and stamina, but also stress level, confidence, joy and so on. And then you have ""bound"" experiences that have a permanent effect on these values - stress can increase fivefold when it reminds you of a comparable bad experience, confidence decreases only half as fast in other situations because of a positive experience for example.

A psychiatrist's job is to find said experiences and either enforce them or help you to remove their negative effects on your stats. Literally everything about your personality was shaped through life experiences good and bad. 

And that means you can actively work on yourself if you can identify not just the negative symptom, but also the reason why you're experiencing what you're experiencing."

I am just now figuring out what I enjoy doing at work, because mostly I generally disliked my work. I have found aspects of it that appeal to me and I am growing in my job by focusing on those.
For me, I am amazing at Excell and data analysis, but I had not yet worked a job where I could do that much.  I am not looking at advancing my training in that.

What I am saying is this. Figure out what types of things you like to do, don't focus on the jobs at start. Do you like writing stories, problem solving, writing code, etc. Narrow down what you are good and and specifically what you enjoy doing. Get those worked out and start to look at jobs that utilize those things. Make lists of both.

If I could do it again, I would have worked for a couple years while figuring things out. Getting into a corporate setting  in claims or a call center, could help to get your foot in the door and give you time to see if there are any depts you're interested in (make sure you ask to learn more from different dept through meetings and shadowing if possible). Also,  many employers offer tuition assistance if you do decide you want to go to school. DO NOT PUT YOURSELF IN UNNECESSARY DEBT FOR A DEGREE YOU DON'T LOVE! 

I also think volunteering is an amazing way to figure out what you want to do. Volunteer at a hospital and see if there are any other jobs you'd be interested in!

,,voodoo15,,,,,"Often times internal transfers within a company will not yield a salary increase unless you take on a role at a higher grade level with increased responsibilities. That said, since you are changing your role from an IT helpdesk to a Software QA, you might be looked on as someone just starting out at QA. So that could be another reason for the lack of a pay raise. Try to find out how the growth trends are in your new group/team so you have an idea of bonuses and annual pay raises.

If you value the new work experience(Python QA over IT helpdesk) and can manage with your current pay, stick around for a year or two and try to outperform the expectations set for you by your manager.

If you really want a significant salary increase, look for external roles.

Now if this is a completely new role, you're getting something valuable in addition to your paycheck - experience. I mean both increased ability to professionally perform a role and a more convincing CV.

That increases your value drastically in the first two years. Put yourself in your future employers role. Everyone (unrealistically) wants a worker which needs no hand holding and minimum onboarding to be productive. What kind of impression does a help desk guy with 3 months QA experience leave on a hiring manager looking for a QA? How about a guy with 6 months experience? How about a year? Two? Two sounds a lot nicer than one or half, especially if you're coming from a role people might perceive as ""lesser"". You want to put some distance between your new role and the old one. 

I don't mean to be disrespectful, it's just how most people making hiring decisions tend to think (in my experience).

I'd tough it out for a year, and then start looking for a better offer. Your current employer is 98% not going to pay you what you're worth, because a) he already has a history of doing so, b) companies really hate giving anyone more than a 5% raise and c) there is this feeling that if they trained you up, you owe them or they own you or some other silly unspoken thing that's not really a thing.

,,StrangeMonk,,,,,"From my point of view, working 9-5 at a few different companies, I could get all my work done in about 90 minutes but I was expected to stay until 5. There was a TON of workplace waste (time, money, meetings, etc) and it just felt like I was part of an inefficient and wasteful system.  I didn‚Äôt feel there was a way to make a positive change because the behemoth corporations I worked for were so set in their ways. Now I work a 9-5 at a small business (10 people) and I‚Äôm busy all day and my work is valued. I still don‚Äôt like the concept of working a 40 hour work week when evidence shows a 30 hour workweek is more productive (or flexible schedules with no set hours), but I do enjoy my job more.

1) The commute - A lot of folks moved a few exits along the highway further away to buy more house, so their commute gets longer. When I was in DC, I either walked to the Metro or drove one mile in to Metro and my commute was about an hour door-to-door. That time adds up, but you‚Äôre not paid for it.

2) More responsibilities - A number of people wind up having (a lot) more to do than you can fit into the old notion of a 9-5 job. This could come from reductions-in-force, covering for slack elsewhere in the organization, or poor managerial foresight. Basically, management asks more work to be done by less people.

Then there are the arguments getting into how to handle work-life balance, but that leads to a couple different rabbit holes."

For me  what is  ""wrong"" with 9-5 boils down to this:

1. not actually ""doing"" anything in my job-  employed for the hours, or to do things that are unnecessary and require much less time than the hours. Eg. I was once an assistant to a director, had to print their papers (when they could easily access them on their laptop).
2. the jobs being often very repetitive and dull.
3. not allowed to spend the time when there are no tasks, time creatively/actively - eg learning something or reading.
4. 9- 5 is rarely 9-5. For me it was 8:30-7pm, because of commute, and slightly longer hours. It just means that there is no time in the day for growth and development, or family or anything else. It can feel like a prison.

It is hugely demoralising, because I am a person who loves learning, and I am essentially being paid not to learn, and not to do anything worth while."

,,stretchyW,,,,,"Some friends of mine were all in on stuff like The Color Profile, Myers Briggs, Eneagram, DISC, ect around 10 years ago.

The thing we learned is that these things are best used as scaffolding for learning about yourself. They help give you something to work off of while going through legit self discovery. Otherwise they are just a horoscope by any other name.

Also that if you have any creativity/smarts you can leverage any personality style into any career field.

My wife's work has them do these things from time to time and she is always on the complete opposite of the rest of her sales department. But it helps her to accel by going after stuff none of the others would and helps her get opportunities they miss otherwise. And some of them have been really important to the company's success.

So just because you don't ""fit the standard"" doesn't  mean anything."

Which is Worse: Non-Matching Blacks or A- Little-Too-Tight Suit? Interview Tomorrow.,db4nxg,fairlyfairies,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/db4nxg/which_is_worse_nonmatching_blacks_or_a/,7,5,1569808245.0,
,,ricosalsa,,,,,Get the new suit. You can use it for other interviews in the near future if you don't get this job
,,cleartulip,,,,,"
If you‚Äôre confident you can get this solved on a quick shop on the day of the interview while still being mentally prepared, go for it and buy a new suit. 

But if shopping can take long / stress you out, I‚Äôd actually say to go with non matching blacks. Try to accessorize so it‚Äôs not noticeable (eg patterned scarf?).  It‚Äôs entry level and if you‚Äôre not yet facing clients, at your age you just need to look well groomed and it‚Äôs ok not to be perfect. You‚Äôll make a better impression by being in the right headspace and answering questions with confidence. So if you need that morning to go over practice questions, etc., then use the it for that instead."
,,Jaxom3,,,,,"Being both male and terrible with fashion I can't speak to either of those problems. But no matter which you choose you'll be aware of it and self conscious during the interview, which the interviewers will definitely pick up on. If you've got the money to spare, go out and pick up something new tomorrow morning. Just make sure to wear it for at least half an hour or more so you have time to get comfortable in it before the interview."

,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"Whoa... alright let me try to make sense of this.

First off, your employer won't give a rats ass about your personal problems. Bringing them to work is a sure sign to make everyone dislike you and see you as someone who makes excuses instead of doing work.

It may be unfair, and you know what? I agree with you. The issue I have with you is that you are assuming YOU are the only one experiencing the crappiness. Your boss probably is too. And here you walk in, probably telling some older dude about some ""internet personal problems"" and they just write you off as an excuse maker.

Look, the work world is cruel, impersonal, and people suck. I agree 100%. I wish it were different. But if I'm your boss and you come to me with that story I'm saying ""screw this person and their bullshit.""

I'm going to give you a point by point guide how to survive work, written by someone who also currently works in a shitty toxic environment. My manager has 3 spots under him. In the past 18 months, 4 people quit him. Thats right, the existing people quit, they hired some new ones (including me), and some of those quit. They still won't get rid of him. He sucks. He is a horrible person and I'm sure even Adolf Hitler would go, ""that guy is an asshole.""

Rule #1:

Management will always protect themselves. Don't be fooled into thinking anything differently. For management to take you seriously you have to have photographic evidence of several of them fucking a baby. They don't give a shit about you, you are just an annoyance. The sooner you understand that, the better.

Also, never think that the management will change.

Rule #2:

Find your peace. Lifelong ""non management track"" office workers have to find their peace of mind. It cannot be work. Most people in the office work world tolerate the shit because they like their coworkers. If you do not like your coworkers, either you are the problem or you picked the wrong field.

At my current job, the coworkers are the ONLY thing keeping everyone here (that hasn't quit yet). There is something about a shitty workplace that makes coworkers bond more. I have worked at a good place and I can tell you, the bonding is much more in a shitty environment.

My peace is I come into work early and work on my side project.

Rule #3:

My God do not tell any manager at work about your personal life. If something comes up that impacts your work, that is normal. But make it vague. Managers will see personal details as excuses.

You can judge, but you would understand it more if you were on the other side. If you are a manager, you get bullshitted all the time. I've had coworkers who had parents that died 3 times and sudden debilitating illnesses that seem to last only 24 hours. I see it as a worker and can get that managers get fed up as well.

Now put it all together, your boss is trying to work their way up a shitty corporate ladder. I guarantee you they know how things are. I also guarantee you that what goes on there is not all that different from most places. So you come in with some internet story and your likely older managers will go, ""yeah this person seems convenient to blame."" It sucks but don't fool yourself into thinking that if you didn't have a mortgage to pay and a job on the line, you wouldn't do it too.

Rule #4:

Finally, work is about everyone conforming. If you don't act like everyone else, you will be singled out. Again, I wish it were different, but it ain't.

The sooner you accept that work sucks, and thats why they have to pay you, the better off you will be."
,,PiemanMk2,,,,,"This sounds terrible. I'm very sorry for you. At the start of this year, and repeatedly since, I've had a mental breakdown for various workplace related stress reasons. I have been lucky that my management have been supportive and kind, but my advice to you is the same regardless.

You need to protect number one, at all costs. To do that you need to figure out what your ""nuclear button"" is. What can be your scorched earth, all bridges burned option? For me it was going to be a company-wide email about the shitness of my work situation, walking out and then devoting my energy to publicising that statement to all who would listen (I work in marketing). It would have destroyed people's careers, mine included, but it comforted me to know it was there.

Now, next step is working out every possible way to not resort to The Button. Get it in writing with HR that you expressed mental health problems to management and now feel you are being managed out. Document every interaction around these as hoc tasks, around your most recent and previous performance reviews, and save it to a cloud backup account. 

Update your CV and make sure you spend as much time as possible, even during work hours, applying to jobs. What industry are you in? What country? If you like, PM me your details and I can see if I know anyone that may be able to help.

Most important: In general, remember that this job doesn't define you. If you feel so in despair that you have considered ending your life, as you suggest at the end of your post, walk out of that job NOW. TODAY. You matter more than this corporate bullshit. I hope you realise and know that. Nothing is worth that. Things will work out, but you have to be here to make them happen.

Anyways, you can do it. If you would like to chat privately, do feel free to PM, I know what it's like to be where you are right now."

,,,,,,,"The vast majority of the population and most likely your parents believe in the ‚ÄúJust World Fallacy‚Äù.

The idea that the world is fair and just, the if you work hard you‚Äôll get somewhere. Basic logic, an understanding of economics and modern politics shows that the ideal world, is a fantasy.

We live in an era where people don‚Äôt get judged objectively for jobs based on being proficient at the tasks, they get judged and possible rejected for the reasons below:

Lookism, Education bloat, Political Orientation, Diversity and Hiring Quotas, Intelligence, Group Think, Cultural alienation & fit or they don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù you.

Or your just asking for too much money and they can hire non-citizens to do your job for peanuts.

The insanity is that none of these are legitimate reasons to deny employment nor can you prove that you were denied employment because of them.

We were lied to, there is no meritocracy, just like how there is no work life balance.

So let‚Äôs assume the worst case scenario, that the market is such a subjectivity mess, what do you do?

Can you really do anything about it? I‚Äôm not saying give up but is it worth becoming depressed over? I get it, I went through two cancers, university and got my first job 14 months after university for minimum wage.

Life isn‚Äôt fair because people make it unfair.

Don‚Äôt waste you finite life worrying about this shit, it‚Äôs not worth the stress. 

Take whatever you can get, do your best, find a new job and tell your previous boss you‚Äôll stay for a pay raise. If you don‚Äôt get it, move on and if you do, stay. Repeat this process until you retire or you hit your personal income goal.

That‚Äôs it, that is all your career is.

,,PsychologicalGarlic5,,,,,"Agreed.

My husband works in customer service for a large company, and he's been applying for different jobs within the company.  Positions that require education and training - like IT, accounting, or security - all make LESS than he does.  To make more money, he has to brown nose with the bosses so he's liked enough to be promoted into the positions that literally don't do anything.

The ones who make the most do the least, while those breaking their backs and doing what they were told was the way to achieve this BS 'American Dream' live paycheck to paycheck without any sense of job satisfaction.

It's painful.  

And all the media around us forces images of this 'American Dream' down our throats to make us think we can better our lives if only we bought this, spent money on that, acted like 'those' people.

Emotional intelligence is a huge predictor of financial and personal success, and sometimes the way US culture socializes men doesn't always help them learn those skills.

,,interstellar-blue,,,,,"I used to feel the way you do. After I worked as a full-time student for 4.5 years, working 1-2 part time / full time jobs all the time to help pay for college, and even volunteered for extra experience -- I thought I was set. Every time I went into an interview employers would say my resume was very impressive, including impressive for my age (22F)... but it was my age that would often be brought up in interviews as a means of depreciating my experience and setting up the narrative that, since I'm young, I must not know much, which means I need to be trained despite my experience, and so I should be underpaid. I was livid when these interviews happened. All my hard work, and people still didn't respect my grind.

You can't expect other people to value you the way you value you. Everyone is out there for their own sake. They are looking to benefit for themselves, their families, etc, and they feel that if they aren't selfish like that, it might hurt them. Sometimes that translates into an excessive lack of humanity, but it's true. Everyone operates out of self interest. Basic human psychology shows that.

That's why I'm so independent minded. I run a number of online businesses so that I'm never 100% at the mercy of some employer or business that doesn't truly care about me. I freelance, so that if I ever lose my job, I'm still making a strong income. I constantly self-teach, because if I can essentially get knowledge that's equivalent to a degree without paying for one, why wouldn't I?

In Capitalism no one can profit without excessively marking up their products, trying to get the highest quality worker for the lowest price, and doing what they can to increase their benefit. Just because that is the case doesn't mean you are powerless to it. Use it to your advantage -- without becoming like those you described, of course. It's possible. Tired of not getting hired? Hire yourself. Create a job. Start a business (it's free online in so many ways). Undergo a project, like a blog or documentary. But don't stay still, waiting for some one else to appreciate you in order for your life to start or advance. When you do that, you give someone else control over your destiny. Just take that power back.

Feel better dude. You don't have to follow the conventional path, or do anything. It's all your choice. Look for a new avenue you haven't tried."

Also, making sure you're prepped well can help ease the stress. Researching the company, prepping talking points and practicing how you'll answer general interview questions can help ease the stress too! Definitely send a thank you note regardless of the outcome. It's just good interview-etiquette. It'll reflect well on you as a candidate and person. Even if you don't think you'll make the cut, you never know what connections you'll make or if you'll run into these people again in that same company or elsewhere so leave a good lasting impression everywhere you go.Also, check out these articles! It's relevant to the questions you asked so some of the insight on there might help you.

,,mkitch55,,,,,"I don‚Äôt get too nervous anymore, but when I was younger, I tried to schedule interviews at the end of the day (when I had a choice). If I worked a full day before the interview, I was generally so tired that nervousness wasn‚Äôt a big problem."
,,RiRi159,,,,,"The thing to remember is that even though you went in for the interview, you are conducting an interview of the company too. An interview is never one sided. Both party's need to come to an agreement that is beneficial to both. If you don't like them, their loss. You interview just as much as you are being interviewed. 

Also, yes send a thank you email/letter if you would like to move forward with them. Try to address it specifically to who you spoke with.

Edit: added a line and corrected a word"

,,2d_Sparrow,,,,,"There's no such thing as a ""good"" Mathematician, or a ""good"" anything for that matter. What you consider ""good"" is just what is recognised by others as ""good"". Ask yourself, am I comparing myself with someone else? Every person resonates with something different, you may be comparing your classmates, mentors, or rolemodels with yourself. You may be seeing them achieve or learn faster but there are so many different facits to Mathematics and to any subject. Perhaps you have a greater pull towards another area and outshine them there.

&#x200B;

There is immense value in being passionate in anything, no matter whether or not you are considered ""good"" by others. It is just so incredibly rare to find true passion that your thoughts about being mature, or smart enough don't really make sense. Figure out how to make it work for you. You can be voice that understands and shares Mathematics, such as a teacher or content creator. You can be a producer, you understand what Mathematicians need to thrive and so you can provide that. Or, just find your own area in mathematics that really resonates with you and you can excell in. Time is not really an issue, if you love it understand that you will be happy living everyday in the world of Mathematics. Ask yourself, what are you willing to sacrifice to live in that world?

&#x200B;

I would recommend reading the works of David Hawkins and see if you can let go of the expectations you have of yourself and the expectations that others have on you. That way you will be able to ask yourself truthfully, what do I want to do with the time that I am given and be satisfied with your answer. But for now don't doubt your lifelong dream, you will always have these difficult moments to overcome, thats what makes the journey so interesting. It would be boring without the struggle. You'll find a way to make it work, look deeper, don't compare, and be true to yourself. Your journey has only just started!"
,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,"with a bachelor's in math, your passion may as well be counting money. 

have you thought about augmenting your dreams/passions toward other avenues? 

save for a few years and start a business, i'm sure you'd enjoy business logistics & finances."
,,MCRAW36,,,,,"Grades have very little to do with success in career.  I was a B or C student but have outperformed my A student pals in career advancement. Its very common, being a good student tends to mean you do what the book or teacher tells you better than others.  People who invent or think outside the box tend to not be great students.  I wouldnt let it get you down or lose your motivation.  You might also consider there are many careers where math skills are heavily leveraged.  Finance, Logistics, Operations and so on value these skills.  Good luck!"
,,21centuryexplorer,,,,,"To be honest, your question doesn't make sense. If what you're saying is true, then most people would not be working. You hardly find people that are qualified, especially in the science and technology fields. Today formal education rarely means a person is qualified. Education is big business and business demands usually hurts quality of service. People become experts at what they do through passion and dedication."
,,gigot45208,,,,,"Besides grades, what‚Äôs your challenge with math? Can you do proofs, or have you dine them? How much support have you had in your classes?  I was in the same boat and I walked away, but that may have been a bad move.  Years later I realized my undergraduate program was really lousy, and the problem compounded by lousy high school math."

,,upquark0,,,,,"Work for a while and save up the beginnings of savings/retirement/investment accounts. Russia isn't going anywhere. You can always take time off when you have an emergency fund or, once you have seniority at a your job (just a few years of being there, at least), you could always apply for a job/sponsorship overseas or take time off.

Just my two cents, but lots of people would kill for a secure job which can financially provide for their wants. And youth is overrated imho."
,,chillin014,,,,,"Totally normal. Some of those questions can only be answered by you and your experiences over time. What is it that you don't like about your US career, etc? I think the reality of life hits after the excitement of graduation/first,new job dies off. This anxiety is what led me to become passionate about financial freedom and early retirement (recommend mr.moneymustache, early retirement extreme if you're into that kinda of thing). I found that financial freedom gave me a light at the end of the tunnel. Either way it's a good time to finally sit down and thing about a direction you want to go now that the arbitrary life milestones of school/graduation are behind you.

I'm sure your time in Russia was awesome, you'll cherish those memories forever. But is this a situation of the grass is greener? Russia sounds exotic and exciting to me relative to a life of work and consumerism here in the US. But maybe you need to take a vacation there and see if it reignites your interest or maybe it's not quite as you remember?

The important thing is that you're asking the ""then what?"" questions. And if you keep asking them you're going to end up finding what's right for you. You are young and you could move to Russia, change your mind about it, move back to the US and pick right back up where you left off. Wish I could help more but only you can figure out what's suitable for you. Personally I'm established in the US, married, all my family is here and as far as I can tell it's a great place to live a healthy life. I know very little about life in Russia but I have visited Europe a few times and was stunned by the beauty and seemingly healthy, simple lifestyles. Just don't over analyze things/stress yourself out. Options are exciting and we have to remember there are so many people in this world who would kill to have a fraction of the opportunity that we do."
,,zoomClimb,,,,,"Wow thanks. That gives me a lot to think about. What do you mean my financial freedom? 
I can't say that I hate my job, it's pretty entertaining with coworkers. But I feel like it's getting repetitive. Just like when you get a new car, enjoy driving it for a month, then you get used to it, and the excitement wears off.
Thinking about it, I could take a vacation to a place I desire. But I think the maximum time would only be two weeks away from my job. I don't think a month would be possible. 
Can I really just leave for a short while, come back to where I left off? Won't I have to look for a new job when I come back, if I plan on being gone for a while?
Shoot ... I don't know!"
,,chillin014,,,,,"Financial freedom just means you save up/invest/live modestly enough that you no longer have to be a slave to a job that you may or may not like. Or you are free to quit your job and do something you enjoy for a lower income or maybe no income. There's a million ways to achieve it but it's basically a lifestyle/mentality. Depending on where you live in the world you could retire at a very young age.

I don't mean to oversimplify but I believe even if your employer wouldn't agree to let you take a month off, you could quit and just pick up another engineering job when you come back. But I have heard of situations where you'd be surprised what your employer will allow you to do (likely w/ unpaid time off) if you are up-front and honest about your intentions."
,,zoomClimb,,,,,I see. I could very well plan a trip. Would have to make sure with my employer about the terms.

Say you meet an old friend five years from now who asks you how things are and you genuinely reply ""great, couldn't be better"".  What does life look like to make you say that?  Both professionally in terms of type of job, salary, hours, scope for advancement, commute, travel etc, and also personally e.g. home life, hobbies, health, friendship groups, where you live etc?

,,bigdaddybuilds,,,,,"Not OP, but I've got a question. How do you determine the next step? I have a detailed picture painted, but I don't really know how to move forward. Any resources would be greatly appreciated."
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"Excellent question! The value in the exercise is that it enables you, as you are presented with different options and choices, to determine which do and don't fit in with where you want to get to.  To give a very simple example, if ""great"" includes being able to drop off and pick up your kids from school, you know that a 60 hour a week job isn't going to fit. 

I guess the next step is starting to identify what options are available and what appeals.  What are you good at?  What do you enjoy doing?  What gives you energy?  What saps your strength and brings you low? 

It's all part of narrowing down the many options available.  But starting with where you're trying to get to, for me, is crucial.

How does that sound?"
,,bigdaddybuilds,,,,,"That sounds fine :)

Thanks for taking the time to break it down."

,,AmbitionScopedotcom,,,,,"It‚Äôs definitely better financially if you can transition jobs whilst in a job. However, doing the best thing financially isn‚Äôt always the best way to approach things.

If the job is severely impacting your mental health and you will not be able to last the 3-4 months it will likely take to get another job (you will be doing this job search in your own spare time). Then it may be best to quit.

Why aren‚Äôt you using them as a referee? At your stage in your career it‚Äôs usually accepted you jump around quite a bit. I‚Äôd just say in an interview that you were looking for a new challenge then talk up the new company. 

Also don‚Äôt think of these sort of moves as a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù. You can always take more action to get back ahead again. It‚Äôs not as if your stuck in your next job forever.

,,CA_TA_491,,,,,"Not a bad option, but I guess my issue is more that if I present it as parting on good terms then they may check with the employer or ask why I‚Äôm not listing them as a reference"
,,AmbitionScopedotcom,,,,,"Well that‚Äôs not your fault.

Not too sure where your basedbut where I am located it‚Äôs very stupid for an employer to give a bad reference. They tend to just confirm the period the employee was employed for and maybe sickness records. Otherwise they open themselves up to being sued for libel and the ex-employee will be able to claim back any loss of earnings due to the bad reference. Proving someone is bad at their job is very hard to prove in court. Even if they can it will cost them in time and legal fees defending the claim. It‚Äôs just not worth the hassle. 

Plus, if someone is leaving to a competitor and the employer felt they were a bad employee why would the employer help their rival out by recommending which staff to hire. "

,,MrMikeGriffith,,,,,"People who tend to be satisfied in their jobs are usually satisfied in other jobs as well. Don't attribute all of this to the job, it could be you, and you should consider this carefully. The social interactions and elements of power and politics will exist in almost all settings that you may find yourself in during your career. As a lawyer, you are in the driver's seat with career. If you feel confident that being a lawyer is not ""your thing"", then think about interesting combinations - there would be many. A JD and MBA combination would be an interesting combination for a number of places you could go with your career (for example).

,,chillin014,,,,,"Honestly I think it's better to play it safe and have a more professional picture. LinkedIn is not Facebook after all . I have never conformed too much to these rules although I did opt for a picture of myself in a suit (from a wedding I attended). I am a bit disgusted that we all have to play the game and pretend like we don't have personalities and hobbies. But if you really consider the purpose of being on LinkedIn, which is your ""professional social network presence"", you want to make sure you're crossing all the arbitrary t's and dotting the i's. It's easier to put that cold, boring photo out there which leaves no room for judgment and then peel away the robotic conformist layer of BS in person when you get a feel for who you are really trying to appeal to.

,,nastygirl11b,,,,,Have you thought about more blue colllar or hands on work? Law enforcement? Firefighting? Military?  
,,chillin014,,,,,"Thank you. I mean you are absolutely right. I am stuck in this cycle where it's easier/ takes less time to bitch about what's wrong than figuring out a path forward. Plus I struggle with what I can do to at least match my salary+benefits. After-all, these are the years when I need to be saving as much as I can. I refuse to go back to school without making a clear connection between what I will achieve or learn there and what my specific job-aspiration is. That's what got me into this mess in the first place. I followed the herd blindly. Anyway, lots of fears to overcome. Half of the issue is I'm dying to leave this place, but the harder part to answer is what alternative career path I would follow. "
,,chillin014,,,,,"Yes absolutely. But I worry I will go into a job that requires physical labor every day and I will quickly regret leaving my lazy ass chair-sitting job. We have machine shop jobs here that I sometimes look upon with envy. Like wow you get to put your hands on something and make a contribution that you can physically see. But those guys have to clock in, work overtime, get laid off the second business slows down, and get paid less. I'm actually very physically active but it's one thing to do it by choice. Plus military/law enforcement jobs are typically pretty inflexible. Perhaps I'm asking for too much. When you read enough so much about exchanging ""time for money"" you suddenly don't want to work a normal job anymore. Life becomes a big math equation.

&#x200B;"
,,bsdworlf,,,,,"I feel that, honestly. Try volunteering at different places, different hobbies, etc. See if any of that sparks an idea. Think about all the things you do love doing and what they all have in common, and then work from there to see what kind of jobs might fit you. Obviously, you need money to live and all that, and I don‚Äôt know your life situation, but sometimes, a pay cut is the price to pay to start a different career, and you can make it up later when you work up in the new career or through a side job (I‚Äôm hopefully about to quit my job to start as a service dog trainer, which makes less money, but I‚Äôm going to make it up by teaching english online and/or giving music lessons). Those personality quizzes online can be helpful in giving ideas of general career areas too. Hope you find something!!"
,,nastygirl11b,,,,,"I‚Äôm in a weird spot as well because I am currently working a corporate office job but I‚Äôm only 25 but I‚Äôm also in the military in the reserves, guard to be exact and I‚Äôm really struggling with wanting to do more military stuff or go into LE or stick with what I‚Äôm currently doing.  However there are many many military jobs that require sitting at a desk or on a computer or working on trucks tanks helicopters or planes. You could look into going in as a warrant officer or officer as well if you have your degree. I enlisted after having a degree but that‚Äôs something you have to decide. But it sounds to me like all you know right now is that you are unhappy and unmotivated. So It sounds like your career regardless of what you are making is not keeping you happy. Maybe a pay cut is worth it if you actually enjoy what you are doing or have some motivation/purpose behind what you are doing. Electricians make really good money. I know carpenters making 40 an hour. I was doing construction before I took my current job and I loved it. "
,,chillin014,,,,,"I don't think the military is a bad avenue at all. I do have some military friends but it didn't sound quite right for me. Maybe if I was a single guy, but then I would be able to entertain a whole world of opportunity. I am pretty restricted with my location. You are young and have great momentum. I knew people at 25 who hadn't done anything but accumulate student debt. Plus you have options that interest you. I would kill for that. I'm not afraid to switch/quit or move on, but given my circumstances it has to be for a ""sure-thing"" or at least somewhat close! "

I understand how you may feel in light of your situation - I chose Industrial Engineering as my initial major in college and ended up changing it due to the same sentiment you've expressed here. Rest assured, you have done well to get this far.

The question I have is: Why not be realistic AND follow your dream of bringing others joy?

My recommendation, as someone who wishes they had a real, practical skill like yours, is to continue developing said skills and to use them to help others out. There are plenty of people who need help from someone like you but lack the means to pay for them.  Donate your time and expertise to help someone out, when all's said and done you will feel amazing."

,,Spatulakoenig,,,,,"Thanks for sharing - it's easy to get overwhelmed with everything!

A few thoughts from me:

1. Make your decisions based on either what you love to do, or what you want to do.

For love, it sounds like you're not quite sure if you 'love' the topics! That's ok though :)

I'd recommend reading 'What Color Is Your Parachute' to get an idea of careers and start mapping things out.

2. Accept it will all change anyway

This isn't a bad thing, and your comments later on recognise this (e.g. About future family and this seeming quite small!). But by bearing this in mind, your decision should weigh a little less heavy on you, and make you happier.

Good luck!"
,,nightwica,,,,,"Thank you for your input and understanding.
To the first point, the problem is, I don't know what I want to do. I know I love linguistics, anything with languages, I like both research and interpreting to some extent.
Thing is, I think for a successful and happy PHD, love is not enough, obsession is needed.
I am a person that gets obsessed by things and can get many things done, but now I don't have this.

I think I will need to consciously consider and 'repeat' your secondfirst :P point in my head, maybe that could help me relieve stress. 

I will look up the book, even though I am not sure reading non-science things is what I shold be reading now (even though I am still reading Reddit, so I guess, I do have the time for it), I must finish my masters thess, prepare for a conceference, and hand in my application all by 19-20-21 April.

,,BubaDjinn,,,,,"It's been two months, how are you doing?

I feel for you. I was in a situation not that different from yours but I was lucky to find that there was one person I could turn to with questions. Believe me, there were a lot... However, I'm a fast learner so it turns out I gained a lot of experience in a new department.

I have a few colleagues that should never have been placed in their positions. What bothers me is not so much that they don't know what they are doing but that they don't try to better themselves. They ask questions to get a quick response, not to learn so they can manage on their own next time. They never learned the basics of the products so of course they can't understand revisions of them. I wish, for everybody's sake, that they would ask for basic training from management. No one likes the feeling of inadequacy!

When asking for training/courses, put it in a way that seems profitable. That X will appeal to consultants/customers/colleauges in a way that will make them turn to you. Or simply because skills in X would make your job easier, i.e you will work faster and get more done. 

Hope that helped anyone.

,,snoozieboi,,,,,"heh, I just guessed there would be an r/career and this post stood out to me.

I'm in a tech start-up that went bad with the financial crisis, still lots of potential but it's only me and my investor left and NOW the really interesting projects start to show up.  

But the problem now is that I'm doing it all, and in the  panic of feeling inadequate in almost all work I end up ""taking breaks"" on reddit.

Right now I just want to be a postman or get seriously sick, but that would probably also ruin my business fairly quick.

I've sown some seeds a few years ago that now have started to snowball and all I'm afraid of is screwing up my part of them. Then again I've got all to win, but I'm just worried about how long my 32 year old body can cope with all the uncertainty.  

For the last three years I have had absolutely now idea where I will be working 6 months ahead in time. Still I try focusing on getting tasks done one at a time and looking forward to getting through the other end.

Confidence is a rollercoaster and watching an episode of ""dragon's den"" on BBC turned my body into a stressful fight or flight state that didn't end before well past 2am and the I woke up at 5.30am.  

Irony is that I normally react to stressfull periods with becoming very tired and worn out after work and in weekends.

In OP's  situation, if he's coming back here, I'd probably ask myself what I'd have to lose to continue or if the best strategy is to quit, get a decent reference and move on to a better suited job.

Also, for CS, have you looked into any start-ups? The culture of a start-up can be radically different from a big company. Depending on the company, your ideas matter more than pure programming skills.

I'm in a somewhat similar boat as you, except I'm graduating in two weeks, I have no idea what I want to do, and I don't experience the strong urges to pursue particular jobs.

I also know of nurses/EMT's who have second jobs, not out of necessity but because they'll have 48 or 72 hours off at a time regularly, and that generally pushes them into the ""well off"" category."

,,TeenerTim,,,,,"You will most likely have different lives/careers over the years. I was an auto mechanic then an aircraft mechanic in the air force. Got out early and worked in auto parts. I took a class and passed the exam to be a realtor. Never sold a house. Became a service advisor at a motorcycle dealer then bought an Atari computer. I learned all about the computer and learned to program on my own. Went to work at a computer store where I met the regional rep from a major software company. Became a trainer for that company and became a subject matter expert SME. Was moved to silicon valley and became a product manager. The went to work for Hewlett Packard. There's more after that but I did all of that without a degree. Most of the time I predicted what was going to be hot and learned it on my own. Being an early adopter usually guarantees a job. Companies don't care if you have a degree these days, as long as you can prove proficiency. Whatever you choose, don't waste you life doing something you don't love. Change."

Why did you decide to get into technology? There are multiple tracks but none of them are easy. IT in a lot of ways is a labor of love when done right, you just get paid better for it than social work.

Why did you start social work if you can't pay your way with it?

WRT social work,  not only does it not pay well, but it is very very draining on the soul.  But I know numerous people who have practiced a few years, then gone on to do a Masters in Psychology - typically paediatric psychology."
,,Super-Body-7597,,,,,"Hi - I have a masters in clinical counseling. I wish I had gone the social work route because there are currently more opportunities and better pay (in the U.S.) for licensed clinical social workers. You definitely did your research and you were on the right track. Some schools even offer programs that allow you to complete your master‚Äôs in only one year if you already have a bachelors in social work. The first couple years can be low-pay while you are working towards licensure, but once you are fully licensed you can make a decent salary. You also have other options beyond working as a therapist. I‚Äôve worked in quality improvement and compliance and made good money doing that. I‚Äôve also taught at the undergrad level. If you have a passion for helping others you should go for the social work degree!
A huge need is psychiatric medication providers. Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are in high demand and you can make a great salary doing that as well. If I hadn‚Äôt struggled so much with science courses I would have gone that route."

Just focus on what you can:
- Do well in school 
- Get exposure to interesting different careers that might suit you, perhaps even finding a mentor that might guide you
- Get internships with companies to get on the ground experience 
- Remember that your career is just one of many parts of a fulfilling life

You are really young and still at college; this is the time to figure out what you really like and feel comfortable doing without the pressure of throwing away a career and many years of experience.

My advice is to find something you really like and explore it. if you are good at something is because you are interested on it, engineering is transferable to other things that are not computer science, take classes and credit that allow you to explore your passion.

Marketing for example uses a lot writing skills and you can make a decent living out of that. 


if you like social work, ux research is an alternative, tech companies rely on deep support of those skills to create products for humans in so many different audiences. You get to work with people and understand core needs. It‚Äôs still a high on demand job even with AI taking over so many jobs. 

Don‚Äôt stress out, you are young and with everything ahead. Take the time to explore what you like, what you are good at, and what you see yourself doing long term. 


Good luck!"

I would suggest documenting your interactions, setting clear boundaries with her (such as requesting very clearly that you need her to go more slowly, repeat herself, confirm your read-back to her, etc.). In the chats, you can confirm things you have said to her in person. You can also say things like, ‚Äúper our conversation, I‚Äôd like to emphasize that it seems hostile to me that you complain loudly what a chore it is to train me. If you have issues with this, the appropriate person to raise them with is your manager.‚Äù  

You can also email her, or just journal, a daily list of the things she has shown you, denoting which things you understand, are still learning, or have questions about. If you‚Äôre the paper notebook type, use a notebook with non-removeable pages and consecutive, dated sheets. 

Threaten to escalate to a manager if this does not improve, or or just escalate, but keep your documents.

,,Mojo80059291,,,,,"As an employer I can tell you, we love stay at home moms who are getting back into the workplace. The primary reason being your load tested, organized and accomplished.   Start as anyone would by ramping up but rest assured, once you start, your employer will see they can trust you as a reliable and driven employee thereby placing more responsibility into your scope and depending on you more.  

That will do two things for you, create income and get you accustomed to the outside workplace again.  Good luck, take what comes to get started and have fun doing it"
,,MasterVJ_09,,,,,A friend of mine finished his MS in Psychology and became a counselor for a high school right after graduation. According to him you just need to search for every middle school or highschool within you area for an internship. Once you completed the internship it should set you up. He got picked up right after for 80k/yr. It's been 6 years now and he is way over the that pay mark.
,,Progresschmogress,,,,,"Talk to your school‚Äôs career center, they will have experience with people doing career switches and re entering the workforce. If they don‚Äôt, talk to coordinators and directors / chairs of your program to make your concern known. The higher you go the better the chance of them having a good contact somewhere that might help you

Pore through the faculty in your program to find people with not-so-academic track records, ask them for advice regarding what type of jobs to look for and closer to the end of the program ask if they have any contacts that would fit the bill. 

More than a specific type of job, what you‚Äôre looking for is to impress the people that could help you find someone that can help you get your foot in the door

In fact, given your masters I‚Äôd try my best to take as many classes as you can from the business school if your university has one, as THEIR career centers are usually actively recruited from by companies every year

In particular, MBA programs usually have a summer internship between the first and second year, so the people dealing with that you want to get in touch with and develop a relationship with (since they likely only do MBA internships but again, from that host of possibilities all you need is one person that knows one person that can help you, so go for bulk and keep shaking that tree until something falls off it)

These types of internships *can* lead to job offers deferred to the completion of the program, and that would be the best case scenario as you‚Äôd have an offer in hand to leverage in negotiations if you find another job upon graduation, BUT my experience with them is from MBA programs so not sure if it applies to yours

I definitively do remember a lot of joint degree students from design school, medical school, and master‚Äôs from other schools in there, so hopefully it‚Äôs something that they‚Äôre familiar with"
,,Upstairs_Expert,,,,,Keep going to school. Get grants and/or scholarships. Do work/study for extra cash. Get your Masters. Then see how you feel about getting your PhD. Avail yourself of all the grants you can. Get student loans if you must. Do all this with an eye towards teaching in a college.

In the meantime I would anticipate his need for updates and email him an end of date update, including work on ad hoc projects at the the end of the day. It is clearly excessive, but it will reassure him. If he asks for updates earlier in the day, OK for a while, maybe pull up yesterday's update and go through it, but eventually try saying let me get that to you by the end of the day. Then after a month of this daily update thing, start dropping updates one day at a time without comment and see if he misses it. Eventually he should be distracted enough this will be something he doesn't miss."
,,RasaWhite,,,,,"Literally just quit my job today because of a micro-managing boss, so I've got no advice other than ""leave""!"
,,Environmental-Bar-39,,,,,Try doing your job better. You are micromanaged when you are perceived as a slacker.
,,Charm534,,,,,"Be patient, he is learning, being a manager does not come natural to all. I like the advice you got on how to handle his frequent check-ins. Now is a good time to learn how to ‚Äúmanage up‚Äù by anticipating what he needs to know and provide it early."
,,HouseNumb3rs,,,,,"It pays the same doing your job or constantly reporting to him.  Take your time composing reports and missives at the expected frequency.  Dance, monkey, dance."
,,cleanhouz,,,,,I just do what they tell me. It's a lot easier. When they do things that are helpful I give them positive feedback.
,,belagrim,,,,,"I'm seeing not alot of direct action that can be taken.

If you feel this manager at least listens to you, email them.  Tell them that the constant interaction is slowing you down amd preventing you from some tasks.  CC their manager.

If you do not get a response ask about the email in person.

If nothing happens, or you get a bad reaction, then go to their boss.  At this point you can honestly say you tried to work it out with the person directly, and here you are.

You do not have to be mean or even assertive, just state how this management style affects you.  Let management solve management issues.

If it doesn't get better, try other channels, like HR.  Talk to those you work with, gain solidarity. 

If nothing helps consider alternate employment."
,,iceyone444,,,,,Look for  a new job - he needs to settle down and go through leadership traning.
,,VegasBiDaddy,,,,,"Micromanagers come from two places and both are equally difficult to deal with. The first, and I would guess the type you're dealing with is the insecure. These managers are so insecure that they have to know everything in it's minutia. Best thing to do is comply until they relax. If in a few months they don't relax, get out. Because they will not change and it will make you miserable. The second is a narcissist. This manager believes that they are the smartest one in the room and everyone around them are idiots. This one you need to flee immediately. They won't change, and they aren't the smartest in the room. Or you can wait it out, because they won't last."
,,nite0001,,,,,"When we're young, we're taught to follow the rules of our parents and teachers. When we get out on our own with jobs, we're still following what we're taught... follow the rules of others because of their titles.   
Since you're a seasoned worker, first... have a one on one with this manager. Ask him how he plans to manage. Point blank as him... are you going to be a micro manager?  Secondly, tell him how you are as a worker. Let him know, you know how to do you job and you've been doing it well for the last 2 years. Find a common ground on what he is expecting and what you have already done that works.  
If after a while things don't change, then YES, go over his head to speak to his boss (and their bosses). However, this needs to be stressed... don't go after him when speaking about him. When you go over his head... talk about the changes and how its effecting the work that is being done. Bosses don't like to hear about productivity or moral going down. Also... offer a solution when you speak to the bosses as well.   
We're taught to follow certain things in certain ways, but as you get older you figure out that I'm just a worker (a number) and you have a right to be comfortable doing the work you've been doing and it's okay to go above to point out any concerns."
,,Pizza_Monger,,,,,"Fight fire with fire. Give back all they requested and then some‚Ä¶ down to every detail but make sure it‚Äôs good work and be professional . Kill the micromanager with kindness. Make sure they feel like you want them to win and your busting ass for them. They are looking for affirmation in their leadership role and need loyal people around them. Some people start micromanaging when they are insecure.

The manager will be over saturated with details and no longer want to ask you for them. Even better, they will regard you as being buttoned up and manage you even less. They will start relying on you more and more on high level tasks rather than the small stuff. 

This is managing upwards."
,,Proper-Cauliflower39,,,,,"Managing up is an professional important skill. I would recommend scheduling a check in and giving them this feedback. I would start with recognizing what the manager is aiming to accomplish (‚ÄúI notice you want to stay in the loop on the projects that I am apart of and I definitely want to ensure you are as well‚Äù). Then highlight how their current method is leading to the opposite of what your boss wants (‚Äúyet, the current way of giving you updates at this frequency is starting to interrupt completing the actual task.‚Äù) and then set the tone for meeting both yours and his needs. (‚ÄúI want to find a way for you to get the updates you need while I can still have the time complete the task of the projects. Can we spend sometime today finding a process that works for the both of us?). Then see what you both can negotiate on. 

I would also follow up via email with a summary of the outcome no matter what (positive or negative). 

If it works, great. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can at least say you tried and can feel validated in making whatever career decisions you want to next."

,,XgUNp44,,,,,"That's honestly not very good advice. At the company I work at, in order to hold any administrative role, you take classes and tests to be sure you do NOT Micro-manage. And if someone does mismanage/micro, there is an anon company number we get ahold of to report them."
,,iceyone444,,,,,"The assistant manager needs to back off, settle down and trust his workers - if not, then they will leave.

,,Environmental-Bar-39,,,,,"Is the OP's manager micromagaging everyone, including the leads? If not then it proves that the OP is perceived as a slacker."

No guarantee on how that approach plays out. They may offer to adjust the base pay, the bonus target, or the bonus calculation. Or they might ask what you want, and then you'll have to decide for yourself what's reasonable.

Bear in mind that you're at equivalent salary at 70% of target and you're coming in from a layoff, so they might be less willing to negotiate... assuming they have room to negotiate in the first place."
,,EndNo6426,,,,,Thanks for your feedback. Great points all around. Especially liked your comment about preferring compensation that's ***guaranteed*** \- either through personal performance or base as it shows that I'm driven to succeed in the role and not just solely seeking a higher paycheck.

If your boss doesn't want what is best for you, then you don't lose anything by tainting the relationship unless you think there is some risk they will sabotage or otherwise negatively impact your career down the line.

It can be helpful to discuss your options with your boss at some point, they may have some insights that you would benefit from hearing. It can help remove at least one factor to weigh up in your decision making if you know your boss is supportive. And if you do accept the new role, involving your boss first potentially gives them, your future boss, and yourself a chance collaborate and agree on timelines/transition plans in a way that that is best for everyone.

This isn't advice on what I think you should do because there are other factors to consider, it's just some perspective on the potential benefits of transparency with a boss when considering another opportunity."
Will a 3 month notice period prevent people from hiring me?,10j8k15,thesunshineband,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/10j8k15/will_a_3_month_notice_period_prevent_people_from/,5,8,1674466333.0,
,,ZenOfThunder,,,,,‚ÄúThey would not let me go before then?‚Äù Do they have a gun to your head? You do what‚Äôs best for you
,,YellowPug22,,,,,"HR based in the UK.
I had a 3-month notice period in one of my previous jobs.
Firstly, when I mentioned my notice period during interviews I didn't have any potential employers surprised about it (3 or even 6 months is a usual thing for some level of roles) and they were ok to wait for the right candidate in most cases.
(My role was not huge, but it was a narrow specialism so perhaps hence the long notice, or it could be just a standard in that department).
Secondly, when I decided to leave I gave my notice but also did it nicely (as much as possible) and discussed with manager if my notice can be shortened as I was happy to provide full handover and make sure the transition is smooth.
Manager was not super happy about me leaving, but she also understood that me staying for every extra month is just a waiting game from my side and I'm not going to be super productive or invested in work anyways, as they don't have any leverage to influence my performance anymore. So they agreed to make it 2 months. 
Even if notice contractually is 3 months, it's negotiable on manager discretion, not even HR needs to make this decision.
Don't worry about any references for future either, as in 99% of cases companies would only officially in writing confirm you title and dates of employment, without any further details on how you left, your performance etc.
Obviously don't burn bridges, but don't worry too much either, your manager and HR are human too (most likely) and they know how business works and it might not be such a big deal. Do what is best for you and do it smart and kindly."
,,damson93,,,,,"Are you in the US. If so despite your contract, you should be able to quit any day"

Ive seen them put people on garden leave but that also prevents you from starting a new job during that period. Theres also a possibility i could use up some paid leave to end before 3 months but only enough to gain me a week or two.
,,YellowPug22,,,,,"Also I would NOT recommend resigning and then looking for a job as it's not a good idea to leave into nowhere, unless you have a good pile of savings and you are super confident that you'll find a role in 2-3 months (current market is tough).

Of course most companies hire people whom they needed already last week, so they all put ""immediately"" in job descriptions. It doesn't always mean they expect you to start right now. If they do - red flag...
Realistically they might take another 3-4 weeks at best to take you through all the steps in the recruitment process and to make an offer and they also are prepared to wait for the right candidate.

You can considering resigning or having the first resignation talk with your manager when you get at least one decent offer. So at earliest you start negotiating your notice period as you start negotiating your future salary at the offer stage."

,,QuantalQuetzal_,,,,,"my cousin is looking for professional guidance in an early career in data science currently but could not find anyone who specialized in it. His parents were ready to pay good some weeks back. I think if you're specialised in something, chances are higher people would want to consult you. Because there are already many who provide career advice in a general way or for school students about college. I have seen more graduated ones trying to look for help in a specific field in the industry.

For instance, I'd hire someone to help me out in the Cybersec industry and how to get into that. But I never found a legit source that also provides consultancy so for now I just learn from the internet. but for career, I'll def prefer some professional who has been in the field to guide me.

&#x200B;

For your website and services, I think college students might need help with that, but again for most things they don't know if there's something a professional could help them achieve better results so they do things like cv and interviews by themselves instead of paying for that. And mostly, those that are your targetted customers might not even know if someone out there could help them what they need help with."
,,Veselinik_4881,,,,,"Thanks a lot for your comment!

One of the goals of the platform will be exactly that - to match narrowly focused professionals with those just now wanting to get into a role.

If you are looking to get into the Cybersec industry, then it would be a lot better for you if you receive interview preparation (for example) from someone who is already in that sector with a few years of experience, rather than someone with a general coaching experience.

The aim will be to have professionals from all kinds of different careers, ranging from Cybersec, to Finance, to Marketing etc., in order for everyone to benefit. So college students will indeed be a target user, but will not be the only ones.

Would love to continue the discussion if you have any other thoughts!"

Personally, even though I knew I needed a break it was still challenging to face the uncertainties of unemployment and submit my two-week notice.

Here are some of the tricks I used to get myself to take a break once I had the financial means:

1. Wrote down all the things I was unhappy with in my current position, just to get them down on paper and make them more tangible.
2. Wrote down all the things I was excited for, so that I could change my mindset from ""ugh I really need to stop working now"" to ""I'm excited to have the time and space to do the things I want to"".
3. Wrote down all the things I had achieved at work in a way that made it feel like a complete project that I could feel good leaving.
4. Gave myself a semi-artificial deadline of leaving around my 10 year anniversary, for no reason other than it's a nice round number. I'm sure you could find something similar in your own career.

is a college degree important to do business?,uuqyt8,Amirbhatti_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/uuqyt8/is_a_college_degree_important_to_do_business/,5,3,1653151573.0,
,,Bubbly_Community6770,,,,,"""Business"" is a very wide term. 
The thing is, a bachlore doesn't determine weather or not you will be good at something, but it sure is nice to have. For a myriad of reasons: the connections you gain with professors. The friendships with future colleagues.  If someone went to a great school, it will be mentioned in conversation 'you have to meet x, he is Yale graduate, the man is insanely competent'. Or their level of education 'I want to introduce Dr. Bla to our board, he is a professor of mathematics at stupid college'.
To name a few.

You can do business with a bachelor in anything. 

If I could go back with the knowledge I have today, I would not look at school as a chore but as part of the fun. 
Oh wait, I am at school again. And it is so much fun now that I better understand what's my take away from it."
,,redwingpanda,,,,,"I have a degree in philosophy from a very well regarded liberal arts college. I work in venture capital. I have worked as a project manager on an internal startup as well as a consultant for our portfolio companies, and now I'm an analyst for the recruiting team. 

Study something you will enjoy and be good at doing, and that you can easily make practical connections to. For me, philosophy made sense because it's about building and understanding arguments, and learning how to learn. I also went to a highly ranked school as an adult student, which  conferred privilege and opened doors (while also confusing a lot of campus recruiters who didn't know what to do with a junior who had 10 years of work experience). 

Look at the jobs you think you want to do. Look at the degrees they do, or don't, require.  Also keep in mind that if/when you go to college, you will learn about all sorts of different things. It's okay to switch your major. I did. 

You'll also change careers in your life. For example. I was an aircraft machinist and welder in the military, then an apprentice in a skilled trades union, then bartended while in community college. Interned in a few different fields while at my four year school, then ended up in VC. Now I'm looking at an internal move to our parent company's data and analytics team later this year. 

---
Some unsolicited life advice that's not directly tied to careers, but that has served me really well over the years: 
I've lived my life through a combination of a few principles. You'll figure out yours and what works for you, but these are mine.

1. be the role model I need(ed). This has kept me moving through some *shit* 
2. will the story of my life sound like me and be something I'm proud of/can live with upon retelling. This was gifted to me by a mentor when explaining why she uprooted her entire family to move across the family for a job at GoogleX (the moonshot factory) 
3. whenever possible, have a backup plan before taking a leap of faith. No safety net = failure is not an option. Sometimes my safety net has been knowing I could live in my car or on my friend's couches - and needing to do so. 
4. asking for help is not weakness or failure, just offer help and support when possible. 

You're asking questions and doing research, trying to figure out what makes sense for you, what you want, and what you enjoy. You're doing great already and so far ahead of where I was at your age, ha."
,,,,,,,"Not really. I have a minor in Business and one thing I have learned studying besides Business majors is that- if you are not going specifically into a field which requires that credentials- it is a waste of time: Finance, Yes.

,,djmurph94,,,,,"Oh my goodness! Hun I am so sorry for all that life has thrown at you at the moment. First thing, and try to take this seriously, take a deep breath or two in and out. I can't help a whole lot with the business side of stuff. What I can say is that schools around the country are just starting to let loose. Right now it's prime hiring season in almost every state, with summer only increasing it. I'm not sure where you live, your education, or your states certification rights for subbing or being a paraprofessional but whichever school district has the most kids comfortably close to you will pay the most per hour or per day for a good substitute teacher and/or paraprofessional. I currently live outside of Minneapolis in Minnesota and work at a decent sized district that pays me about $160 a day for subbing. My schedule is flexible, I can take days off if I need to, without any repercussions except for not being paid that day. I'm looking to move into Minneapolis specifically because their substitute teachers get paid $30-40 more a day, and include insurance after 3 months of subbing. It's not easy, but it's flexible, it puts money in the pocket, and it will help in a tight situation. Many districts have assistance programs for staff in helping with housing, food, more education. I know MANY schools are desperate for special education and ENL teachers, and will increase your salary or help pay for more certification if that is something you are interested in doing after a few years in the district. And being a sub or Para is the perfect way into transitioning into such a career.

In no ways am I saying you should go and be a teacher, but based on your history and what seemed to be a positive time working with students, this would be a good path if you were interested. I'm literally coming out of a grad degree program with similar issues in poor working management, not enough time on the job and being cut, and being kicked out of my support system. I've been a paraprofessional for about a year and it's work, but I love my students and for a single guy it's ok in terms of money. Working for MPS, I'll make 3-5,000 more each year as a substitute and have the option of gaining a special education license through a collaboration with one of the local colleges. 

Your other bet, I still recommend substitute teaching, but coursera has The American Dream which affords free Google, Salesforce, and IBM certificates to go into more of a technology career. You will absolutely find a job in tech with something from here. Buy a few study guides, take the career certification tests, and with your experience you should find an entry level tech job within a wfh environment and room to move up in no time.

Again, these are just my opinions, these are my plans for ""making it"" at the moment and surviving."

There is nothing wrong with moving around a bit, but you're clearly unclear about what you actually want. 

I suggest you doing some deep self exploration before making your next move. Explore your skills, passions, interests, and habits to begin narrowing down. 

Also lean into your past experiences to help guide you. What have you liked, disliked, done well etc..

There are many tools that can help with this, so pm me for specific suggestions. 

Also, your post is written in a similar fashion as your career - rather erratic. This may be a personality trait that needs taming or else you will spin your wheels and never make progress. You can't have it all in life and every choice means giving up something else. Respect this fact.

- Ever consider sales? Yes you help other people make money but usually you are rewarded for helping people buy something.

,,ZoeticLark,,,,,"I'd like to chime in as well- my career path has been quite varied.  It didnt make sense when I was younger, but it's beginning to, in middle age!  

There is strong mental pressure toward ideas around career that dont necessarily serve everyone, in terms of how we ""think"" things are supposed to be.  But times are changing and I think the future is much more rooted in what *feels* right.  Trust your gut, as the other person said.  Use that gut instinct to feel into the experiments/experiences you've had.  Maybe you find that you learn more about what you *don't* want, than what you do, but that is still valuable information.  Gather information yes, but at the end of the day, let it all go, breath, and feel into what your gut instincts are telling you. Going for a walk or doing something active can be more helpful to some, meditation better for others.  

Sounds like youre already doing that, to some degree, just dont let your mind drive your decision making process if it hasnt been working for you so far."
,,johnny_firepants,,,,,This sounds like good advice but it is flawed. Find something that you don't mind doing that will provide a stable solid income that you can support your life with.

Some people fall somewhere in between.  I have some clients I work with long term and others just a few weeks. I am looking forward to transitioning back to a team.   It's not just what you do, it's how you do it, too and in what context.  And the deeper you dig, the more nuanced roles you can find in almost any arena. Keep going, gaining experience, shifting your perspective, till you hit on something that resonates, then keep going some more!  Youtube and wikipedia have been a great help over the years as I experiment and reflect on my path."

Pros: basically none of those apply if you work for a company like Redfin.

,,hetty_sorrel,,,,,"Hi, congrats on the jobs!

1. You sound fairly early in your career, so you have time and flexibility. What a lot of us don't have at that point is money xD I would personally take the higher one and pivot because of this: let's say you change jobs again in 3 years. If you take the $24 job now, that's the salary (plus raises) you'll be negotiating from next time. There are valid reasons to consider the $18 job if that's what you really want to do (and are the benefits, work, co-workers, hours, etc comparable?). BUT compare: let's assume 3% annual raise (US average): Starting at $18 you'll need [10 years](https://www.easysurf.cc/fsalary.htm) to get to $24. Starting at $24 with same 3% annual raise, you'll be at $26 in 3 years. Higher salary earlier is a big plus because (1) the raises amount to more, and (2) you're at a better negotiating place for your next job.
2. For me, it might depend on how much effort I put in to help the person but in general I wouldn't be offended or upset. People have to do what's best for them. Maybe once they interviewed they decided it wasn't a good fit, or they got something better.
3. I don't think you're under any obligation to tell her, but would you like to keep her in your network for future? If so, a friendly text or call might be a good idea. I probably would for that reason but networking is pretty important in my industry.

,,,,,,,"It's really interesting to read this thread from the other side of the fence. 

I was in a technical role for a long time and eventually became team lead and then manager of a technical team. They liked the work I did so much that they asked me to become part of shaping the strategic direction of the company. ""Great"" I thought.

I currently hate what I'm doing. When I was technical I felt like I was creating something, or resolving issues. Right now, as someone mentioned, I feel like I am babysitting people who add value to the company and I don't feel I'm adding value. I'm not sure if I hate the job or that I've completely lost all confidence but if I was asked for a 2 minute elevator pitch for the work I do I would struggle for it, even though everyone around me says I do a great job.

Currently there is a potential opportunity for me to go back to the technical side of things but also an opportunity to lead a project whose success would give me a huge footing for a career higher up the ladder. The reason I am here is because I am at a crossroads now and don't know which way to turn.

,,hetty_sorrel,,,,,"When I first got out of undergrad I interviewed for a job I really wanted (""Company A""). I didn't hear anything back and meanwhile I was going on other interviews. Company B made an offer and I wasn't excited about it, but I needed a job.

I called A and asked if they had any updates (it was about a month by now) and they said they were still considering. (I found out later that they first offered it to someone with an MS and they were waiting for their response.) So I took B and wouldn't you know - at the end of my first week, A made an offer.

I felt horrible and my undergrad adviser helped me with the job at B. I talked to my parents and they both unhesitatingly said to take the job I wanted and not worry about quitting after a week.

My mom also said, ""If they needed to lay you off after a week, they'd do it with no worries,"" and she was right. So I turned in my notice and changed companies. 

Honestly, now I'm over 20 years in the industry and this happens all the time. Shortly after new hires start is the riskiest time. No one likes doing this, but you're acting in good faith. You weren't trying to be deceptive. Do what's best for you üòä 

I would just present it as something you can't turn down, and when you leave try to stay in touch with them, maybe leave them a good review on Glassdoor. Sorry for the long post but good luck!"

,,DiamondShrimp,,,,,"Don‚Äôt feel bad. Do companies feel bad when they fire you?

Your coworkers and manager will understand. All of them would do the same thing in your shoes. Just give two weeks notice, make plans to transition or close out all of your work, and be respectable. No company will truly ever put your interests first, so it‚Äôs up to you."

,,catdoctor,,,,,"So, it wounds like you would prefer to go to the company with which you have yet to interview (let's call them Company 2) rather than the one from which you just accepted an offer (Company 1)? 

Personally, you don't have to tell Company 2 that you have just accepted another offer. You might disclosed that you HAVE another offer, as this might incentivize them to get their butts in gear and make an offer to you ASAP. 

As for Company 1... Here is where things might get sticky. Have you signed a contract yet? If so, read your contract carefully to make sure there aren't any penalties for backing out, if you decide to go with Company 2 instead. If you don't have a contract yet, you might want to tell hem you're interviewing with one more company. Tell them the truth: You really like Company 1 and are thrilled by their offer, but you have been waiting for an interview from Company 2 and would like to explore this opportunity. They might be very understanding or they might be assholes and rescind the offer as soon as you tell them this. There is a small chance you'll end up without an offer form either company."

,,thejezzajc,,,,,"I'd start by thinking very carefully about which role you think will be best for you in the mid- to long term.

This is one of my favourite thought experiments which might help you:  
  
Say you meet an old friend five years from now who asks you how things are and you genuinely reply ""great, couldn't be better"". What does life look like to make you say that?  
Both professionally in terms of type of job, salary, benefits, hours, scope for advancement, commute, travel etc, and also personally e.g. home life, hobbies, health, family, friendship groups, where you live etc? Paint a really detailed picture of your ideal life five years from now.  
  
Of the two options, which (if either) fits in best with that picture or is most likely to help you get there?"
,,jnt85,,,,,"Something I wish I could avoid at all costs. I mean my friend said ""XXX does not care about your performance or matters after that,"" but it's still something I want to tread carefully because I value it.

,,SamACunningham,,,,,"Whoever XXX is, they are likely to care if you resign within a couple of months of starting. Hiring someone is a time consuming and expensive process."
,,jnt85,,,,,"I recognize that, hence my dilemma"
,,SamACunningham,,,,,"From my point of view (and obviously its completely up to you), the minute you chose to use a friend to get into this company you should have mentally made the decision to stay.

**TLDR:**   
Get a hold of yourself , don't try settle for career lower than your caliber (Stress / Anxiety will keep eating you alive.).   
You have invested alot of time in Carreer development, invest some into taking care of yourself.   
   
**Long Answer:**  


Why it is not you : 

\- ""An Architecture Grad"" --  You're not an average Joe. (Not a R-tard either)

\- Lots of Carreer change (customer service, sales, design and ESL teaching) : Probably you ended up in Toxic work environment (one after another .. it's rabbit hole. ) 

\- I am 28 years old now, a big big failure -- Probably single and not alot of friends around you.   
\- Therapists  -- They can support not cure it. You gotta take care of yourself.   
What to do :   


\-A fresh start ( Move to new town , new place and get a job at Vibrant place like Starbucks / local cafe / where co-workers are very friendly to each other.) This wil help you sleep better at night without Meds.  (Give it 3-6 months but not more. )  


\- Get an Average job in your Industry. (Go for junior / intermediate role -- easy role and after 6 month or so be ready to move on to new job. Internal Promo / Transfer is much harder than external.)   


And remember : What you can achive in 1-2 years being smart is much more than dumbasses can achieve in 10 years.  Invest in your health and self. Move out to new town and start it from scratch.   
 

Good Luck !."
,,Striking_Equal,,,,,"They tend to find creative outlets, as opposed to tedious and/or logical based work. We need both, and could argue with modern tech, creativity is more highly prized.

But, there is also health components.

I'd check your sleep schedule, is it consistent?

Are you exercising, meditating, and eating clean?

These things can have dramatic differences in your ability to focus.

To the science if you're interested. There are generally two primary chemicals for focus, dopamine and acetylcholine. Both of these are very much dependent on your diet and lifestyle. Heavy drinkers (more than a couple a week, yes it's that minimal) have deficiencies in acetylcholine typically, causing lack of focus. If you have bright lights after about 10PM, it can rob your brain of dopamine the next day. Lack of water, lack of breaks in alignment with your 90 minute biological rhythms, unhealthy environments. The list goes on. You can improve your brain function significantly by doing very free things.

Others think working in IT is hard and stressful because as server admin you have to be constantly aware on the status of your network and and need to be ready to pull all nighters or work on the weekend if the situation demands it. I personally love it and made it my career.

* Finance: building complex models to predict the market
* Defense: missiles, sensors, tanks, aircrafts, drones
* Medicine: prosthetics, potentially lifesaving diagnostics or therapeutics
* Industry: drilling for oil or other natural resources, mechanical equipment in factories
* Civil: Roads, bridges, and buildings
* Green technology: solar, wind, and other renewables, agriculture
* Etc...

It sounds like you have an aptitude. The next step is to find out whether you like the work. It often involves modeling (usually using a computer), brainstorming, drawing technical diagrams, reading scientific papers, and writing your own reports. Then find an industry that aligns with your values. It sounds like you don't like tech, but there are plenty of other industries that need engineers. You might not be able to find one that aligns perfectly, but I feel confident you'd be able to find one where the work is rewarding and meaningful to you. 

Final thing to note, seeing as you were considering psychology as a profession, I reckon you have at least an above-average EQ as well. This is a rare trait amongst engineers, and it will help you stand out. Actually, if you do end up abandoning your psychology career path, those skills are transferrable to \*any\* other career path you end up choosing.

Good luck!"

Also is this a career you anticipate will continue to flourish in Finland, Sweden, or the European country you decide to settle down? 

Sales is a good career but it is high pressure. You're constantly pushed to close customers, especially with product support up-selling. It can be lucrative but at the expense of a very stressful environment.

What is the least stressful and best work-life balance job with a business degree?,lz43s2,ArpadNagy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/lz43s2/what_is_the_least_stressful_and_best_worklife/,6,4,1615045259.0,
,,elliotcreeves,,,,,What did you initially hope to go into with your degree? And what is your hobby? Choosing a path that you enjoy based on your interests and personality will be the least stressful option.
,,EighthDayOfficial,,,,,"Honestly, I'd recommend something like teaching. There is no middle anymore. Accounting is fine, but everyone I knew had to hustle at some point.

I got a great job with a great work life balance, but I also got a PhD. In general, they don't give the good jobs to people early on.

Keep in mind that what you want now may be different from 10 and 15 years from now. Now that I have kids and a family, the idea of being away from home longer isn't as bad :-)"

,,schillerstone,,,,,"I just spent probably 15 hours writing a cover letter and redoing my resume, including a new section called Other Information , which is a list of presentations and reports that I either contributed to, was featured in, presentations I gave, and a link to a youtube recording of me. Assembling those resources is a large part of the time spent. 

Now, with that new Other Information section, my resume is three pages. However, I have a lot of white space and use bullets (explained next) for easy reading and absorption.

The reason for the new resume is that I am applying for a job several steps up the ladder-- a stretch job. The way I handled density (to appeal to the human tendency to skim) was to scale back my experience to no more than three sentences and then indented below with a new title,  "" Relevant Experience and Outcomes"" , and there I added bullet points of items pertaining to the job. Yes, I am omitting things, but only items less germain to the job. So , even though general advice is to be specific and quantifying, those 1-3 sentences may not be. I one case I wrote, Managed XYZ Division. this employer would have an idea of what that means. No need for me to rehash all the duties. The accompanying ""relevant experience"" bullets are things I want them to know. 

Think realistically about what an employer needs to know. General things inherent to a specific position should not take up precious space."

,,schillerstone,,,,,"Thanks for the 411. I am SO curious about what they do.  I've been told many times I should be a recruiter or career coach.

I used to work at a college and I always mentored my worker students, which ended up including resume work. My contributions were always much much better than Career Services'. My cousin's husband was out of work and working with a headhunter. I was being nosy and asked to see his resume. Now, this guy was a big shot and in charge of lots of money and staff. I told him that his resume could easily be one of a new college graduate who had held great summer internships. He told me that his recruiter told him to phrase it that way in order for those screening softwares to pick up keys words. Well, he could do both! Even though my cousin told him I was the first person she knew who had linked in and had credibility, he wasn't receptive to my help. I thought his resume was so disrespectful to himself. Lol"
,,sharknado523,,,,,"My least favorite part is how to tailor a r√©sum√© & LinkedIn when you're trying to make a transition. I've been working with a career coach since December and basically, the Cliff's Notes are that I've been in B2B sales for my whole career since college (customer service roles before that) and I am starting MBA classes in August.

I'm trying to pivot to consulting but the thing that sucks is I can't find any consulting gigs that want me because all I have is sales experience.

And my current sales gig is at a company that is kind of a sinking ship, so I'm trying to pivot. But like, I sell power tools and lifting equipment and I've interviewed for roles selling other types of manufacturing experience and they keep saying I don't have the right experience & contacts. One manager straight up told me ""I'm only interested in hiring people who have worked for a competitor.""

Sorry you think construction equipment is sooooo different from manufacturing and lifting equipment. Would it take me 30-60 days to get settled? Yes. But it's not like I've been selling perfume at the fucking mall for eight years."

,,matt_moneytalk,,,,,"Congrats on taking control of your life/career! Here are a few thoughts from my perspective but obviously I'm not a professional so take it with a grain of salt. 

1. You took a certificate course and your gut is telling you to go into event planning. That sounds like you definitely should!
2. In my experience switching industries / roles is HARD. Like no one even looks at my resume unless I'm a perfect fit. My suggestion (especially giving the state of the world) start out really low on the totem pole somewhere. Can you find a catering job to do on evenings and weekends. Maybe you can move up the ladder or use the experience to move to a better fit. What roles are in the industry that you can easily get and do in your spare time?
3. You might want to consider finding another media job you can easily get. Like reach out for positions you are a shoe in for. If you're current workplace is toxic then find another company you can chill at for a year as you launch you're new career. It might help with the stress, especially if you take on a role you can do in your sleep.
4. This goes along with 3 but no need to jump ship immediately. If you are able to work at the event planning industry in your free time until you find the perfect job that matches or exceeds your current salary.
5. I wish you luck and you got this! Sounds like you're doing all the right things, you're just taking on a hard but worthwhile goal!"
,,elliotcreeves,,,,,Do you have an option to work less and work on a side hustle? You could start running your own online events or in-person ones as restrictions begin to ease up?

,,thejezzajc,,,,,"First of all, congrats on taking the certificate and already doing some informational interviews - that's a great start and many people don't think of that.

It sounds like what you might need is someone else who can help you to take a step back, get out of your own head and assess what you've done and what you could do next.  Essentially I'm talking about some kind of coach.

If it helps, I have [an episode on my podcast about what coaching can do for you and how you can find one](https://changeworklife.com/why-you-need-a-coach/) (including ways to find a coach that isn't very expensive if money is a big concern)."

I think your best bet is to try and work on this project directly, as close as you can to the CEO of the parent co if possible. They will be able to override existing policies (except those that require board-level approval, which may the case for an equity share but not a revenue share or commission).

Is there any chance you can find someone who would support whatever you have stated.  Marriage isn't the end , but make sure you take control of that decision. 
Usa right now is healing , jobs have become tough.  If I am right non stem education courses have only 1 year opt. Although looking at the current situation can say Biden is going to relax the visa system but end of the day if your opt expires and you don't get h1b you would be in a fix to return back.  
Positive thing of masters would be you would be entering usa in the supposedly good time.  Trump wasn't really the best time in usa I can vouch for that.  
But in the end I feel finding someone with your same thoughts would be a really long term investment. That would be best and it would be a good idea to stand your ground on that.  
Mental health space in schools in India is very much underdeveloped I am involved in a school myself run by my relative , I am seeing private schools having budget cuts. It's better you research into organisation like mantra4change. I have been involved with them to upskill teachers and training teachers for better interaction with kids. Offcourse they work with non profits. Covid has been tough on many schools , it would take them time to invest some time to think about children's mental health. But it's definitely important for right now once the online mode goes away.  Students have been too long at home , and it's consequences will appear.  

In short I feel option 1 is good , but be aware of the pitfalls of visa , and running away from problems helps in short time. But you need to come up with a way to boost your self worth when you are away.  Lastly make your family understand it's wrong to treat you like that."
,,OriginalReaction4424,,,,,"Bless your heart! üíõ 

I‚Äôm not an expert, but I will share what I think. 

I think ultimately going to the US and beginning Masters depends on the opportunities you have or can seek at the moment. You seem to have an interest in mental health, so if you find a good opportunity in India to work on that aspect while completing a masters online, then that might be good. However, it also depends on what you want, do you prioritize getting away from your parents over an opportunity in India? If do think that (objectively) you parents will control your actions or/and have a detrimental effect on your well-being Whilst being in India, then that may affect what you want to do such as choosing to go to the US. 

I know it‚Äôs hard when you have adamant parents, but try to find ways so you and your parents get along together better. And it‚Äôs probable that you‚Äôre already doing your best to understand them. 

At the end, try to take it easy on yourself. And take care üíô"

,,SergeantTurner,,,,,Absolutely!!!!!!
,,kiwi1034,,,,,"Hi! First of all, most university programs have either some elective courses or something like a 'minor' program, which would be a few months filled with courses other than computer science in your case. You can fill these spaces up with physics courses to get at least some basics in physics!

Furthermore, it might be worth talking to a counselor of your university and see if there is any possibility to do a double degree in computer science and physics (if, of course, you feel comfortable with the level and the workload of the courses and feel like you can handle more). Physics and computer science are not too far apart and there are many overlapping fields, such as modeling physical phenomena. Maybe it is possible to work out a plan to get you 2 degrees in 5 or 6 years. Double degrees are getting more and more common, I myself have studied math and physics and had a great deal of fun doing both degrees!

Finally, you can choose to focus on physics during projects. Maybe you have a semester project or a thesis at the end of your study. See if you can find a professor who is at the border of both fields and if you could do something that is applied to physics!

I think it is very well possible to educate yourself in both fields and to find a job that is on the border of the two. Given of course, that you are willing to work hard for what you want!

I hope this helps you in a way and please let me know if you have more questions :)

The best of luck to you in your studies!"

,,cynicalnewenglander,,,,,Lol I have an MEM too. Now I'm looking how to use it.
,,bessytam,,,,,"+1 on product management. I think a few red flags from your list or things that need more clarification on are:

A) you'll need to do presentations and ""own"" the product. So collaboration and presentations actually go hand in hand. Doing more speaking projects or toast masters may help you overcome thru anxiety

B) you'll need to do long term planning regardless. Cant just do conceptual work to bring people together but not plan ahead. Planning ahead is a huge part of bringing people together . In the PM world this means bringing together sales, marketing, design, commercialization, senior stakeholders, engineers, Technical solutions engineers, customer support etc.

C) you hate design but you'll still need an understanding of why it's important. In a product management job you'll be working with a ux designer to make sure usability is there. Products won't just adopt itself, it'll need a great user experience to assist users in adopting features

Hope this helps. Sounds like PM would be a great fit. I've helped engineers transition into product before, I'd say the above challenges are quite universal. 

Let me know if you have questions!

Then again, I am far from an expert in these things so maybe there is a way to renegotiate your contract."

If they are drastically underpaying you I personally might bring it up in 60-90 days in a supervisor 1 on 1 meeting. If they really need you and you have great performance it seems like a no brainer that the manager is going to fight to keep you.

It will say all jobs within the last 7 years or something to that affect. I rarely see this. I do see most current job more often. However you can get around this by just not listing it and telling the recruiter that you took a temp job due to being laid off but did not include it on the resume because it's not applicable to the position. I've done this with no issue and recruiters have told me no issue. Plus it sounds better that you are working on your certs and a temp job rather than collecting unemployment.

,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"Its hard and you will never know unless you have more than one person who has worked there that you trust tell you to your face.

My current place I've been at for nearly 3 years. While it did get better recently, the first 2 years were awful and I regretted it almost immediately. I had to stay though because it was my only option and I toughed it out.

Every. Single. Coworker. I asked during the interview process said they loved it there. The second damn week on the job those people started quitting, and 3 mos after I started almost every non manager that interviewed me had quit. They started complaining about the place in the breakroom almost immediately after I started and it was a giant ""da fuck?"" moment for me.

I'd say that a toxic place isn't the end of the world as well. It depends on the situation. If you are in a field that is high demand, it is likely bad places to work at have high turnover. So, there is a lot of job security in being at a place that can't fire you (because everyone quits). If you learn to deal with it, it can actually be freeing. 

That is how I survived. I outlasted the worst manager (they finally removed her!!!! holy crap she was evil) and got switched to a new manager that while he has his quirks, is definitely better (still plan to leave soon hopefully). 

What it has taught me is that if a place is shitty at the start to you, its not personal. They are shitty to everyone. When I started, I got told ""I was a mistake to hire"" like two weeks into the job because I told them my wife was going to give birth. I told them in the interview, and specifically asked for 2 weeks off as a condition of employment. 

My manager (at the time) had a response ""you didn't get it in writing."" For a job where everyone has advanced degrees, it was telling.

Turnover since I started has been \~200%. Unusual and very costly. That is what led them to make some changes finally, but it was probably too little too late."
,,,,,,,"Toxic is a very general term and is up for interpretation depending on personal preference. With that being said, I use a combination of Glassdoor and Indeed reviews, LinkedIn profile snooping to see how long folks stay with the org.

I also look for more subtle signs during the interview. The energy of the folks interviewing you can be very telling. And by energy I mean literally... are they tired, how is their posture, how quickly and gingerly do they move about the room , do they smile naturally. And on major sign for me is to look at bags underneath their eyes. Workers that are exhausted and unhappy always have major bags under their eyes. Think of an over worked animal, the same is true of humans. They just look bad."

It‚Äôs kind of hard to tell but it sounds like you may be changing careers and it‚Äôs hard to say if you‚Äôre coming in too senior to some positions or constantly having to learn new skills, it could help explain some things."
,,unfoldcareers,,,,,"I'm so sorry this has happened. However..... I think there's quite a bit of silver lining here. Hear me out. 

1. It sounds like you haven't found a good fit for your skills. You've outlined what you're good at - processes, systems, writing, collaboration/working with others. This could be a range of roles, but potentially IT Technician or other role that allows you to use these skills. 
2. You have been fired 4 times, yes. But you've also had 4 jobs for longer than a handful of months. This is still GOOD resume content. To be honest, everyone has bad sh\*t in their background, but that doesn't mean it destroys careers, lives, resumes. I have been fired before (and so have more people than you realize or that admit it). When you prepare your application, don't let the firings get in the way of your actual experience. One of your roles lasted 4.5 years?! That's great - more than enough to demonstrate your value to the company over that time. Most people these days jump from job to job in less than 4.5 years anyway. You're actually ahead of the game.
3. It sounds like you're applying for everything under the sun. I would avoid that and focus on perhaps 1-3 areas. Hone your resume for each one of these areas. For IT roles, for example, focus on your experience with systems and processes, writing, and working with others. For an operations role, probably focus on similar things but also any project management experience, improvements you made or suggested, and efficiencies you created or recommended. This will make a big difference in getting you in the door.
4. If you don't have the skills you want, use this time to take free online courses to get better at something or at least show a future employer that you care enough to improve your skillset. 
5. When you do start your next job, leave your history of being fired at the door and go in with a plan. Ask for clear objectives that you need to meet within 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and a year. Then try to meet or exceed those. Constantly check in with your manager as to how you're doing and document all of the good things you've done so that you can demonstrate your worth during performance reviews or just generally.

I know this is easier said than done, but hopefully this is somewhat helpful."

The longest job I've had was 6 years, that was selling for a particular company. And, really, I took a transfer halfway into that job so I really had two 3-year gigs for that place.  

I have never been promoted. I have applied for promotions, but never got one. I started out on the bottom and I've stayed their for 30 years since I first got a job the summer after high school. 

After college:

1) Got a job, got FIRED

2) Got a different job, left that job and decided to move across the country instead.

3) Got a job to get by, got a different job, eventually got a job that FIRED me.

4) Got a different job where I was asked to leave.

5) Got a job, got a job, got a job. Bullshit stuff -- all of it. Got FIRED.

6) Joined the military. Hated it. Left after 3.5 years

7) Got a great job, but it ended when the non-profit I was working for couldn't get funding. No more job.

8) Got a really cool job, pay sucked but I liked it. I was working for a political candidate. He didn't win the election. Job OVER.

9) Got a job selling. Did okay, had a great boss and support, but the pay was terrible. I left after 4.5 years.

10) Took a job as a marketing manager at a small company. Got FIRED after 90 days. (The CEO didn't like me, I think he thought I was too aggressive.)

11) Went back to sales -- that's the 6-year gig. I did okay, not great, but okay. I had a couple years of great success there. Not because I'm good at sales - I'm not - but because I was with the right company selling the right product at the right time to the right customers. Life was good.  Then the market changed. We weren't the right company anymore and we **definitely** were not selling the right product anymore. Got FIRED for not selling enough new business.

12) Got a job at a retail store, Liked it, pay SUCKED! I quit to go to . . .

13) Got a job as Asst. Mgr at a retail store. SUCKED. It all sucked. Pay sucked (They straight up lied to me about the $$$ there.), hours sucked, job sucked. S U C K E D.

14) Got current job in January. They're going to FIRE me.

Then I would say that if your managers are as good as you feel they are, then they will understand if you tell them that this role is not for you. Managers of course want work to get done, but the good ones know that miserable employees are bad for business. I would tell them that you greatly appreciate their patience and understanding, but this role is not for you. Try to be clear about what does not work for you and what you would like to do next.

The third thing I would recommend is that you ask the managers to help you find something that fits you within the same company. I'd the managers in sales are that understanding, it's a good bet that the company has a decent culture and you may be happy staying there if you can find something you enjoy. Good luck!"

 At 6 months, have a check in with your manager and be honest about your feelings. This will give your manager fair warning you‚Äôre unsatisfied and if they‚Äôre good, they‚Äôll try to find a solution that works for both of you."
,,brand-new-reddit,,,,,"Does your workplace have an Employee Assistance Program?

I was in a similar situation as you, started off well the first few months but it started getting really really hard after a while. With SIP it became near impossible for me to get out of bed every morning and I spent the day waiting for the clock to turn 5 so I could legitimately sign out from work. 

I was let go in a mass layoff. I knew I was gonna have to make a decision but I was to afraid to, so I guess it's a good thing they did. 

Now after being let go I've started exploring the Employee Assistance Program and I'm working with a counsellor through that. I've found it really helpful to talk through my challenges and find definite next steps. 

I choose a career counselor but they do have other types such as mental health and so on. 

I'd say being able to talk to someone is the biggest boost there is. It gives you something to look forward to, someone to have in your corner, and you can start talking about why you hate the job and the specifics of it with them, and strategize ways to improve your day to day being. 

What you describe also sounds a bit like imposter syndrome - where you feel you're going to be exposed at any time. 

Good luck!"
,,Jaxom3,,,,,"All of these things. Also, you can try to find a replacement and make sure they start before you leave so you have time to train them. This isn't really your job, it's on the company to find/train people, but it might help avoid guilt ferrets"

,,acrazymixedupworld,,,,,"The question you want to ask yourself is if you want the job or not. If you want it then what does it matter that the first pick backed out. You were apparently a close second, and you don‚Äôt know why that other person got the position. They could have known someone, they could have been internal. No use creating a storyline and carrying around a grudge for something only you, a recruiter, and your hiring manager know about anyways. There will always be people ahead of you, and people behind you. The reasons aren‚Äôt always fair."
,,SamACunningham,,,,,"If you wanted the job before the rejection, then take the job. Don't let your ego get in the way. There's a multitude of reasons people could get the job over you, it's not necessarily that they were better than you or that the manager particularly preferred them over you. Could be as simple as an internal candidate, or the other candidate having a significantly shorter notice period, or they know somebody in the company.   


You're way overthinking this, having said that if it's going to be an issue for you then you shouldn't take the job. Interviewing and dating are not the same in this respect at all, the comparison is usually made to show that both sides are trying to get to know each other as opposed to the old trope that it's the interviewer just trying to get to know the candidate."
,,Wanderingaroundyou,,,,,"If you like the job and people take it. I was rejected for a job that reached out to me a few months later for a different but equal job. I was pissed when I was rejected but I liked the people and job offer. I also worked with the person who got the job I got rejected for. I loved the different job probably More that the original one I applied for. You never know why you didn‚Äôt get the offer (I do, the other person was friends with the person leaving and very qualified) but it doesn‚Äôt really matter because they do want you in the end."
,,cssexecutive,,,,,"Completely agree with the above. There will always be some supposedly better suited to a job than you. Sometimes in an interview process a company will find that person, sometimes they won‚Äôt. Hiring is a very inefficient market, as opposed to say the stock market where broadly speaking, all information is available to everyone at the same time and you can make decisions based on that. But even if companies do hire their ‚Äúideal‚Äù candidate, its not always the right thing to do. Often finding someone who is less experienced, with a point to prove, who can grow into the role can have better results. Finally, you just happened to know there was another candidate. What if you didn‚Äôt know? Would you have accepted?"

An extraordinarily high # of people (something like 70%) that accept counter offers end up leaving within 12 months regardless.

Take an honest look as to what made you start looking for new roles. Was it truly because you weren‚Äôt being paid what the offer is paying? If you were being paid that, can you honestly say that you wouldn‚Äôt have thought about leaving? I would put money on it that you were interested in other opportunities for reasons other than more money.

It generally doesn‚Äôt set a good tone ‚Äî you break a lot of trust and you‚Äôre often labeled as a high flight risk.

You‚Äôre in a good place ‚Äî you got a new job that‚Äôs higher paying. Cash in on it and leave on good terms."

I'm sure there will be a lot of people like me who want to get more than their worth as a result.

Aside from that, there's some toxicity here with culture and 'just another day' -- but no more than any other place.

That said, I have a slightly different perspective now. Career growth is not always linear. Think about what you need right now, there's nothing wrong with that. 

The hotel industry is in for a rough few years. If you've ever considered getting out, now might be the time. 

However, if this is the industry you want to be in, then make this opportunity work. Take the job, stay in the industry, build your skills and contacts. When the industry grows again, you can find a better position. 

Right now you need a job, so there's nothing wrong in taking this one."
,,,,,,,"Take the job.  Any job is better than nothing.  Keep looking though, and don't feel like you need to stay for long.  When I switched careers I went through about 5 or maybe 6 employers in about 3 years, each role a step up.  So keep moving up."

You could start preparing your resume and post it into linkedin etc. 

Meanwhile ask for maximum extension of your job in the current company, at least till you get another offer. You could even have an open talk with your ceo around ‚Äúother responsibilities that you can take up in company‚Äù. But you may have to prove him that you already started to enhance your skills for those rolls.

Also, start rigorously updating your skills for tour job interviews; as a hack you can start read through a lot of requirements for the job title in the job postings, by heart all of those terms, and google it to find what it means conceptually.

The aim should be to continue same job with same salary by doing more work or find another job(any job as you have an urgency, later you could switch to desired job if you want to..)But rememberer brother, This will make you feel damn confident about you once it is done. But strictly decide that for the next 2 months you don‚Äôt loose it within you, so avoid over drinking to forget the tension.

,,ccwj1989,,,,,"Depends on how frequently you job hop (generally speaking). 

it's not either-or."
,,Mimi_cam,,,,,"It depends on your industry. People in media move around a lot. Maybe people in other sectors move around less. I would say if after two years at a place you've stopped growing then you either need to move within the company, either horizontally or vertically, or you need to leave. If you're stuck in a job that you know like the back of your hand you're likely to get bored and sloppy. At least that's the case for me."
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"Look at it from the perspective of the potential employer. What story does your resume tell them? If you keep moving to more senior positions it suggests ambition and a willingness to develop and improve. If it's between lots of similar positions then maybe it suggests lack of commitment. 

On the other hand, if you're in the same position for 20 years with no progression, no development, what does that say? Lack of ambition? Resistant to change? 

This was one of the things my guest and I talked about in [this podcast interview](https://changeworklife.com/get-that-job-top-tips-for-a-successful-application/) about job applications. Might be of interest."
,,Juntis,,,,,"Some fields and industries expect a more frequent changes or turnovers while some do not. In tech and programming field on startuprs for example,employees are expected--and sometimes are encouraged--to resign within 1-2 years. Things would be different for, let's say, banking and investment on corps."
,,childish_landino,,,,,I worked at a wearables technology company in San Francisco for a few years. We went through a ton of growth and hired 30-40 people on to my team alone.  I remember the teams decision to not hire someone who was nearly perfect for the position because he had been at a new company every 12-18 months for the last 7 years.
,,LawrenceHugh70,,,,,2
,,PiemanMk2,,,,,"It's both. 

If you've been in one place a while, then usually the best way to get a pay rise is to move to another company. 

If you move around every six months though, it looks strange. Why can't you/don't you stay for very long?

I would say moving in a year, but no more than 3 times in 5 years is a good rule of thumb to follow."
,,Scarface74,,,,,"As for as #2. Why does it matter if you are already employed?

Think about this in terms of a decision matrix 

     You interview/Don‚Äôt get  job | You interview/get job
    You don‚Äôt interview/Don‚Äôt get the job | You don‚Äôt interview/Get the job 

None of those four choices leave you any worse off. So why not interview? By definition if you interviewed and they gave you an offer, they didn‚Äôt care about your job hopping. 

All that being said. Try to stay at a company for at least two years preferably three and you won‚Äôt have to answer that question."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Ok thanks.  So I'm guessing if you are doing it every month, probably not good, but if you switch jobs every year, that's good?"
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Thanks and yeah, I am definitely getting bored and sloppy.  My industry is retail but I want to do something different, preferably a remote job."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Hmmm... that makes sense.  Thank you.
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Interesting.  Thank you for the info.
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Honestly that seems really dumb logic but good to know I guess.  He was probably amazing for that job but... I don't know.  It honestly feels like they are punishing people for shopping around and broadening their horizons.  And 12-18 months, that's almost 2 years per job, so that's not even short."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Hahahahahah crap
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"I don't job hop but I'm considering it.  Getting very bored with my current job.  Mind you, I've mostly been working retail jobs and I'm thinking at least for now I want to do something else in retail/food service/entry level jobs and/or a remote position.  If I could find a way to work remotely or maybe mostly remotely with a part time job in the outside world, I think that would be ideal.  

Working at the same place for 7 years has really made me want to do something different, and not stagnate at one job as long as I did. 

That seems like a good guideline.  I think it takes me a while to get sick of a job but I am definitely sick of my current job.  Being a cashier is not something I want to do long term."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Thanks for the encouragement and information.
,,SamACunningham,,,,,I think its closer to 18-24 months.
,,acrazymixedupworld,,,,,That‚Äôs short when you‚Äôre building a team in a setting that requires innovation and critical thinking. It can take years to build a cohesive team with people who trust each other and know what they‚Äôre doing.
,,childish_landino,,,,,"I might be a little inaccurate with how long he had each job. If someone had a string of jobs, each 18 months in length, I would hire them. But this individual had probably 6 jobs in 7 years.  When asked why he left each job, I don't recall his liking his answers.  I understand leaving your job for a new better opportunity, or your project wrapping up. But that didn't happen for this person. My team worked on hardware related projects that often last at a minimum of 2.0 - 2.5 years."
,,PiemanMk2,,,,,"That makes total sense! I think it's normal to get the itch to move every couple of years. Or at least, to reassess.

For me, it came at 2 and 4 years. I ended up staying put both times, but did seriously think of leaving.

7 years in one place is a long time! If I were you I would definitely be looking at moving."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Ok.  What is that based on, out of curiosity?  And what if you hate the job or they are doing something illegal or they aren't paying you?"
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Fair enough.  To be fair, I've mostly worked retail and odd artistic jobs so I don't have that much experience in that kind of industry but for a cashier or stocking job that's a long time.  Not too much team building, critical thinking or innovation there, but I won't deny the fact that it can build skills and challenge you."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Yeah if jobs are project-based I could see job hopping looking worse than for other industries.  I can understand your reasoning.
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,Ok thanks for your opinion.
,,SamACunningham,,,,,"If every job you take isn't paying you or is doing something illegal then there is a bigger problem at play. Quitting a job early once isn't job hopping.. 18-24 months is from experience, you only just get your feet under the table in the first 9-12 months. Obviously this depends on your career path and industry, expectations vary. What type of job are you doing/looking to do?"
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"What is the bigger problem at play?

Ok, fair enough.

I work retail and I want to do remote work but I'd settle for a mix of remote work and front line work (retail or food service or something entry level).  Honestly I'm not completely sure but I feel like I'd be happier doing remote work because I'm introverted and I'm much more focused without interruptions from coworkers and micromanaging bosses."
,,SamACunningham,,,,,"Bigger problem if you keep joining companies that don't pay you or are doing illegal activity is a lack of research on your part before signing the contract. It's very easy to do research on companies these days and get feedback from ex/current employees on glassdoor.com (you are highly unlikely to be the first employee of the company to deal with these issues).

I would assume front line retail workers are probably more likely to job hop at quicker intervals, but I have no experience with retail/food service industries. I was coming at it from more of an office job viewpoint, where there is often a reasonable cost to train you up as well as the high level of effort required for technical jobs. In those situations leaving in less than a year regularly will definitely cause people to have second thoughts."
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Ok thanks.  Yeah I should research more.  

I think they job hop more but I'm not sure."

,,MavenCareerCoaching,,,,,"UX design, much like most forms of design has phenomenal scope in the job market. As a UX designer, you can work as-

User analyst- to study user behavior and motivations.

Usability analyst- to study the experience of a user while interacting with your creation

Information Architect- develop structure within he contents of the website

Interaction designer- to design engaging interfaces with well thought out behavior

Visual designer- Working on the aesthetic appeal of the application

UX designer- to drive the development and communication of the user process.

In an increasingly digitized world, a career in UX UI is extremely lucrative for the future. It gives you the option to choose between working in a corporate and doing freelance work. You  also have the option to specialize in an area of interest or master the whole process. 

If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out personally.

Despite the contemptuous attitudes back-end and full-stack people have towards front-end or QA people, my work has not become any more interesting or rewarding since shifting towards ""meatier"" development.

Also, I went to school with a lot of older students who were doing just fine in their careers prior to jumping on the tech hype train. Tech is a good industry, but it's not *that* good, and people definitely do fall by the wayside. It's not worth leaving a good position over, especially if you can do the degree part-time."
,,Career-Hacker,,,,,"First, you are never to old. I‚Äôve changed directions many times in my IT career. 

Second, let‚Äôs get you back to work. Being that you have some coding stills start there. Put yourself out on Fivrr or Upwork. And get you some coding gigs. 

This will get you experience and confidence. You can then use this to promote your abilities to your future employer. 

Third, connect with everyone you have ever worked with on LinkedIn. Us it as your personal CRM system and reconnect with everyone. Start conversations and find out what they are doing and their challenges. Let them know you are out of work and looking for opportunities. 

Leveraging your network is way more effective than applying to online job postings. Use those that already trust you."

,,Dionysis_insapien,,,,,"I agree with you there theres certainly learning and improvement with experience in industry. However its generally as expedient it can be and with a rather narrow focus toward solving the specifics of the current business need.  
I'm finding myself interested while looking over the modules in a year of study thinking it would be great to spend a couple of whole months at a time on wide ranging aspects of the subject.

Working with Computer Hardware (20 credits) - Core
Web Development Project (20 credits) - Core
Networking and Operating Systems (20 credits) - Core

Just the handful here would be spending time programming for arduino/pi, then delving into web apps & onto networks & OS.
Could well be a problem with my own motivation but I've never been able to work in advanced learning like that in and around full-time employment."
,,Dionysis_insapien,,,,,"I did a bootcamp which did give me a certain level of knowledge. 
I dont know if university is a definite need, I could go on in employment. 
Ive just been shifted to test automation away from the goal of full stack dev.
The underlying hope would be that on the other side of University I would be able to be employed but moreover have the ability to employ myself and leave that world behind completely. 
Be able to have my own business, something I know is that I'm not a strong enough developer to do that now on my own."
,,Dionysis_insapien,,,,,"Yeah I've generally been stuck with java test automation. My coding know how has increased massively over the last year and a half, but I just want to get over the hump and be producing production code - 

From that position I feel you then have the flexibility to work on any area. I've had a good few chats with devs that feel they're now bored with setting up databases and creating an adapter for them, and want to move into dev ops.

I'm early in the industry, I can quite easily see myself following that same trajectory when the novelty wears off and the meatier development becomes just another level where you essentially produce a lot of repetition from project to project.

I'm in the stage though where its all interesting, sit me infront of an IDE all day at work and ask me to solve problems with it, the time flies and sometimes I can't believe my luck I get paid for it - when I see people stacking shelves all day;

Even though my pays not great right now, I feel lucky for being able to do what I do for work. Just the fire there underneath wanting to prove myself as full-stack that makes me forget that I am roughly working in the area I want to be."

In general it‚Äôs a fine place to live. Yale University is here. There are many good restaurants, bars, stores etc."

,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,UX would be good for a someone used to research. But it's a very competitive field. You'll need training and experience.
,,thejezzajc,,,,,Why are you even considering UX?  Your post seems to be pretty clear that it doesn't interest you in the same way as video editing.  So why not concentrate on that?
,,mxrippa13,,,,,"Not in either field, only an associates degree"
,,mxrippa13,,,,,"You are right, The only thing is from what I see online is you need to spend 2 to 4 years learning video editing.  Where as UX seems it can be learned enough to land a job in 6-8 months... 

Am I wrong about video editing taking over 2 years?"
,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,An associates in what?
,,thejezzajc,,,,,I'd imagine it comes down to practice. Do it for ten minutes a day and it will take longer than if you do it for three hours a day.

,,bessytam,,,,,"You problem right now is because its a family business and that you're stuck in one role doing one job.

I talk about the below method in my 3 part video series but happy to elaborate. and PS for context, I help people get into nontechnical roles in tech companies so the below answers may be geared towards that.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yhXTkjwP2PllZQf0o5YvDu0dlFOmCE3

1) Find out what you want & what fulfills you. this does not mean having ""one passion"" other than insurance (haha) it's more about the lifestyle you want

2) Understand your strengths. the more work you do on your strengths, the happier you are. This is because you are actually in an environment that supports you to be the best of you - you can find this out through taking strengths tests and also understanding when you are ""in the zone"" in your current job. aka things you wouldn't mind doing on a saturday

3) use your business, industry, and role experiences to transition. Eg. your business experience is the tools/products you use on  adaily basis - if you have experiences using Google/FB ads to promote your business, you can transition to a Google/FB role. if you have experiences using Intuit accounting software, you can move to Intuit. Those are great companies that you can later transition into different roles within the company to achieve your ultimate goal of being able to work anywhere as long as you have the skills. I'm living this dream working at Google as a Global Product Lead.

Hope this helps

Im really torn between 2 paths,fvhbkk,dimlevi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/fvhbkk/im_really_torn_between_2_paths/,5,4,1586106921.0,
,,StatusEmployee,,,,,"I think they‚Äôre both awesome choices that‚Äôs pretty financially stable! So either way, you can‚Äôt lose. 

I don‚Äôt know much about merchant navy aside from what I‚Äôve heard in passing. I have a degree in computer science but not in cyber security so take everything I say with a bit of grain in salt. 

From my perspective, these are the defining characteristics: 

Merchant navy: 
- kind of bro-y
- stuck on a boat with the same people for months at a time 
- pays well, but you don‚Äôt have much time/flexibility to spend it since you‚Äôre docked for limited hours usually at night 
- always with work people. Hard to have life outside of work so if your coworkers are asshats you‚Äôre kind of stuck with them 
- they take care of lodging and food (?) for you so a lot of complexities of ‚Äúadulting‚Äù (like paying the mortgage/rent) is taken off your plate 
- on the other hand, dating might get tough 

Cyber security: 
- kind of nerdy 
- stuck in the office/cubicle work with what you expect with lots of khakis and button up polos or buttoned downs 
- typical 9-5 
- must take care of things like mortgage/bills and stuff on your own which could be a hassle 
- more freedom to spend your time/money however you like (which can be a good and a bad thing) 
- more flexibilities with dating 
- need to go out of your way to find people to hang out with after work. Either join clubs or go to meet ups (making friends is surprisingly and annoyingly difficult when everyone isn‚Äôt living in close proximity already like a dorm room) 

I mean that‚Äôs how I kind of see as major differences. Merchant navy is more ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù because you‚Äôre more limited with time/money and who you hang out with because basically work becomes your life. Also, the culture is probably more bro-y. In cyber security, it‚Äôll probably be a typical 9-5. So you have more ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù after work and how you spend your money, but that can also be a negative thing since... it could be a lot of hassle just to setup life. 

And never underestimate the power of culture. Do you want the ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù buttoned down culture? Cyber security is probably up your alley. You think that‚Äôs stupid and boring? Maybe merchant navy is up your alley. 

I‚Äôm also speaking in super general terms that might border on fiction... but I figure I‚Äôll throw in my initial impression."
,,wanderlustpower,,,,,"Hey, everyone goes through this dilemma about their career! Don't fret! I recommend trying out Coursera/edX/ Udemy etc. online courses about Cyber security. Try a course or two on it and see if you really like it enough to get further training on it.

I met a 42 year old guy who worked on a cruise ship for 13 years, he loved it until it got too repetitive. Once he had enough, he decided to enrol in a Le Cordon Bleu Program to do something new that he enjoys.

So don't be so hard on yourself, just because you don't have a clear path like some other people doesn't mean you're going nowhere.

Feed your curiosities and find some clarity."
,,dimlevi,,,,,"thank you!  what do you mean  by "" ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù buttoned down culture """
,,StatusEmployee,,,,,"Oh, I meant to say that it‚Äôs the type of culture that respects buttoned down shirts and khaki pants and people talking about their investment properties and 401k portfolio. I am probably 100% biased in this because I live in suburbia and so all the cyber security people I know live in suburbia, but it‚Äôs very much that vibe, which I think is very different from the Merchant Navy vibe."

,,chrissycm,,,,,"Other issues...

... people need people, we suffer from being disconnected already, a more isolated world is not good for our health. Even on the basis of illness, too much protection from infection results in a weaker immune system. Especially amongst those developing one. (Yes, let's minimize the worst of outbreaks - no, let's not live in a world of bear perfect sanitization.) But more so, social health, you need actual contact. Digital contact is better than none, but you need more than that. For me, I get depressed when I work from home. I work where I work, at least partially, because it has a high level of team engagement.  

... sort of what you said, but on a societal level - stratification of economics. If everything moves more online, then those who were privileged to grow up with computers or live in cities where internet is more accessible/faster have an advantage,  and those already at a disadvantage fall further behind. This is one of the issues my husband critiques at the school he teaches at. They are talking about going online for a few weeks, but he mentions 30% of his students dont have internet at home (maybe cellular internet but not full workstation computers). He is frustrated,  because those 30%, on average, are also the ones who struggle the most, and they will be the most hurt by that decision.

... that said ... I am a big believer in finding new solutions like this. It would be great if I could find a way to do my job from home so when I am in that state where I have no problem working, but I am definitely infectious,  that I could stay home and protect others. Instead, I know I cannot take 2 weeks off work, so I will call in one to three days, as needed, but then I come in, and everyone gets sick. It isn't a good method. But my current job isnt really one I can do from home either... and the jobs I have done from home weren't good for my health. It would be nice to have the choice."

,,paz_vegas,,,,,"Well done on making the first step into each of those two areas you're preparing for! I have a way of thinking through these sorts of dilemmas. Remember when you were a toddler, learning to walk? You have a few directions you can go, but you can only take one step forward at a time. Sometimes even stumble one way, and then a few steps back to move forward again. You'll only get clarity through engagement, so keep doing what you're doing but eventually you'll have to focus on one that you feel will set you up for the next closest thing that you want. Then stick to that direction for a while. E.g. you work in IT and try to master coding and see you enjoy coding whilst network with people in the embedded side of business. You can still study your MBA on the side.. but have to pick when is suitable to start that journey.

Some things I would consider.. but certainly there a lot of other things you should be thinking about.

1. Do you want to be in LE? This is huge commitment and certainly not a position one should take because of the great pay (you can easily find more lucrative careers). This should be your top priority. 
2. How high does the salary cap out over time? This something you'll have to do for a long time and if you ending pay is $80K-$100K (certainly respectable) does that meet your goals?
3. If join LE work there for a few years and then quit because it's not a good fit, you'll have to restart your career but you'll be older and may have more obligations in your life.
4. If you're passionate about nursing, go for that. You can make up the money later and having a career you enjoy is priceless."
,,acroporaguardian,,,,,Thats pretty good for that job and education level. Nursing is higher paying but as you mentioned does have more financial risk.
,,blueopera,,,,,"They are very different careers, so that's something you really need to think about.  If you are interested in both careers, you could consider trying out law enforcement first, since the barriers to entry are lower.  Then, while working as a cop, start going to school part-time.  If you find you really like law enforcement, you can skip that step.  Or, if you find you don't love law enforcement or you really prefer nursing, you can switch to full-time school towards the nursing career.

It is nice to have a salary, especially with the level of debt so many people have.  It's especially nice if your job will provide tuition benefits."
,,Douchebagnumber1,,,,,">Do you want to be in LE? This is huge commitment and certainly not a position one should take because of the great pay (you can easily find more lucrative careers). This should be your top priority. 

Yes, I do. I have always been interested in both law enforcement and the medical field. Money is not my sole reason for getting into LE, but it is definitely something this is a high priority when looking for a career to get into. 


>How high does the salary cap out over time? This something you'll have to do for a long time and if you ending pay is $80K-$100K (certainly respectable) does that meet your goals?

Like I said, just as a regular patrol officer here in Philly, the maximum one can currently make over time is a little over $76,000. However, there are ranks and higher positions, where well over 6 figures is the normal salary. 

>If join LE work there for a few years and then quit because it's not a good fit, you'll have to restart your career but you'll be older and may have more obligations in your life.

I am not really worried about this, because everything you do in life is a gamble. Although this job will have its ups and downs, I think that I'll like it because I find it to be a noble career. 

>If you're passionate about nursing, go for that. You can make up the money later and having a career you enjoy is priceless.

I am not passionate about it at all. I just initially picked nursing because it was the first thing I thought of when I got out of high school. But after getting into all of my health and science classes, I actually turned out to dread them and realized that I may not actually like that career."

,,corndoginc,,,,,I usually schedule my appts during lunch or at the very end of the day. I'll work during my usual hour long lunch break during those days to make up for the time. Most employers should be pretty understanding of health appointments and won't care as long as you're getting your work done.
,,alexkayownsabus,,,,,"Personally I take time out for doctor's appointments as needed. Usually letting my boss know I have a doctor's appointment means they let me take the time I need.

My partner is in a similar position as you. Chronic pain, depression, thyroid issues, etc. It is, as you say, a part time job managing the doctors, insurance, treatment and everything else. She's rarely worked FT jobs but will be starting one in a week. She's extremely nervous. She managed to get her employer to agree to a modified work schedule where she comes in around 6 or 7 and leaves at 2 or 3 so she can make appointments as needed. They had to take it up the chain of approvals but she was lucky and they OK'd it. Bottom line is you need to communicate with your employer. They should not be holding it against you if you have medical needs but can still perform the job.

I can empathize with how nervous you are, especially if you recently experienced a work related issue due to your health. Lean on the support network you do have and do what you can to get the time you need.

Good luck!"
,,JCrotts,,,,,"Usually salary, like 8-5 is an 8-5 job. However, from my experience 8-5 is more of a recommendation and coming in and leaving +-15 minutes is not a problem unless it creates a problem. For example, if you have an appointment at 8 and you come in at 8:15. As for doctors appointments, just schedule them and let your supervisor know you wont be there. You will have to work with your supervisor often for stuff like this. If your boss is to much of a butt head to let you go to the doctor then just find another job. Other than that salary is kinda nice. You have a guaranteed paycheck that is the same every week so its easy to budget with."

,,gensubs,,,,,I'm a career coach. You might want to look for leadership opportunities in your current position before switching jobs if you're new. You could talk to your supervisor about your longterm goals and see if there are any roles you could do to help groom you.

I would also do informational interviews with people in roles you want by finding them on LinkedIn or through your company. Best of luck.

,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,"Trades would be king here and you'll find that in trades, the amount you make relative to the living expenses of the area is different in every state. For instance, a bulldozer operator in NYC can make 70k-80k/year but the cost of living is very high in NYC. Still, 80k with a ""frugal""lifestyle in NYC may garner you a better life than frugal in West Virginia, where a bulldozer operator only makes 40k on average. You can also find pockets where some trades are in such a high demand and are in an area of such high living costs, that both contribute to the workers in that area making unbelievable wages. 

There's also some careers that you can theoretically get into without much schooling or apprenticeship, that pay fair wages. Audiovisual camera operators make really good money out in Hollywood for example, and often those working for big studios only have a 6mo to 1yr certificate course under their belts. 

There's always manufacturing as well. It's pretty easy to get into a SMALL shop, without ANY schooling, if you've got the determination. And the small shops do pay ok. You can hit double your state's minimum wage with little investment in schooling in manufacturing, but if you're state has a big manufacturing base, chances are there stre LARGE global shops that only take college grads and those who've been working in the small shops for years (sometimes decades) There's also niches like union mining and union trucking and things of that nature. A lot of the unions won't accept new apprentices that don't have prior experience; however."

,,sparklesandfries,,,,,"Is it an NDA or a non-compete?

NDA is fairly common and is no issue - just makes sure that you don't disclose confidential information wrongfully to anyone (internally or externally) during and after your tenure with the company. 

Non-compete is trickier. In my previous job in consulting, it meant I could not join any of the top consulting competitors that they have listed, for a year. Fortunately I did not need to break the non-compete, but if you do have a need to, unless you're working on some groundbreaking stuff, it's commonly negotiable."

Are you left out in any way?  

Never.

What would you recommend or change if you could?

My co-workers keep me in the loop about tasks related to the job/position. Between email, IM, and video conferences, I am not missing anything official. However, I know nothing about workplace rumors, gossip, office politics, unofficial news and the like. 

There is not much, I would change about working from home dynamic. However, I do feel that if I ever felt the need to move up from my current position, I would have to leave my current company to ""quit my way"" to the top."

,,IncoherentPenguin,,,,,"Risk/Rewards are really something only you can assess but obviously the risk is that it doesn't go your way and they think your not the right person for the job and kick you out the door. The likelihood of that happening though is about 0.1% in my opinion. Reward on the other hand is that they realize that your superior isn't performing her job properly and needs to be replaced. Again a low probability outcome. Your likely scenario is that HR talks to your boss gets her side of things, realizes that you could use some extra help and asks her to be more inclusive. Net result she gets pissed off because you went to HR makes your life at the company for the next few months.

The way I see it documenting things doesn't always mean that things will go your way in the end. 

My advice is two fold, imagine you are at an interview at your next job, and they ask ""Give me an example of when you had difficulty working with someone at your last job, how did you try to resolve it?"" Now think of the best possible answer to that question. The one that might cinch you that new job, now do that. Also while you're at it. Look for another job. Sorry but she's been here longer they are just more likely to side with her."

My advice? Work backwards by deciding what job you want, not what degree sounds interesting. Talk to people who have jobs you might be interested in to see what they're like. Be open minded and talk to as many people as possible. Look up job stats like median salary, job growth, hire rate, and job satisfaction.

It's not fucking easy working full time while going to school. Impossible, for most, actually. I have a friend that is taking 1 class a semester and he has to do his homework in secret at his desk. 8hrs at work, 8hrs for sleep, and 8 hours for home-life is not a lot of time when juggling work and school. In terms of life itself, you're approaching the ""in the thick of it"" years. This is life, man. Gallop or get off the horse. If you're wealthy and you feel like going to school for something you're extremely passionate about, full time, then go for it man! 

&#x200B;

Go for it, but recognize you WILL MOST LIKELY struggle through the next few years. I am in my late 20's and I am finding that action sure as heck beats theory.

I worked 50 hours a week, plus volunteered and managed easily taking 1 class every 8 weeks. It‚Äôs about scheduling things appropriately and limiting you social life. You don‚Äôt have too sacrifice much, especially for a degree program that isn‚Äôt stem.

As for going for psychology, if that interests you go for it. Your BA degree doesn‚Äôt matter much unless your looking to go into a very specific field. Your work experience will matter more.

You can get jobs in a number of different fields with a psychology degree but you will need a Masters to boost your pay significantly. That‚Äôs should be expected for most career paths nowadays. Master programs are more intensive, but it‚Äôs usually expected that students are employed full time, which is why you can go part time for most programs.

Male, 26 YO here.  
I was in your shoes Sept 2018. I fucking hated my job. Working 12 hour shifts (only paid for 8 hours) making 45K a years? Such bullshit. 

So I said FUCK this SHIT I had enough I deserve much better. 

So i took a vacation to Europe to see my friends (i had some savings). Had a blast. 

I did not work for 6 months. I just chilled and smoked weed. Then it got booooring so I ask myself what I want to do plus money was low. 

I liked computers so I was like fuck it that's it. I started learning for some certifications and next thing you know I landed an entry level help desk job (with tons of moving up opportunities) making 50K, working M-F 9-5 (before this I was working all weekends and holidays) and having a good time. Life is good now. I have friends again and a life. 

Good things come to those who wait my friend.

,,sparklesandfries,,,,,"As someone who was an intern 4 years ago and have some interns helping me now, my few tips:
- Be a sponge, always ready to absorb. One of the best things you can do is to learn fast and be focused. Be curious. Be open. 
- Offer to help anyone, on anything. Nothing is ever beneath you, and it's going to be fun getting to try doing new things. Later on when you get a full time role, you won't be able to try stuff as easily, so best to do that now and everyone will appreciate your help too- win win. You also establish connections this way. 
- Don't try too hard to act too professional or too seriously. Be yourself, but decently and humbly so. No one expects you to be the most mature or knowledgable but you can surprise people with new perspectives. Perks of being young!

Basically, treat your internship as exploration, experience, and education. Learn as much as possible and help as many ways as you can, and you'll be an awesome intern!

Most importantly, have fun :)"

I once worked in a group home and quit when I realized they dumped way too much work on me.  My coworker confided the role had ruined his marriage .  The coworkers who succeeded did so by blowing off tasks and documentation and leaving it to us.  And never taking on the shifts we were given. 

My advice is talk but with low expectations. And look for and apply to other jobs with high expectations. Make this a temporary situation one way or another,

You need to go above and beyond what your coworker is doing to secure promotion. You should also have a conversation with the new boss to she how the boss is evaluating performance and how they are making their decision."
,,theabundancepsyche,,,,,"This might sound harsh but if your boss doesn't know what you're doing, how do you expect him to recognise you? Think about the situation from his/her shoes. What are the problems that they are trying to solve? Can you help them solve these problems?  If so, communicate that to them and be on the same it. You could call it ""kiss ass"" but in reality it is viewing the problem from their shoes and stepping up to help them achieve their goals - that's what gets you a promotion. As you can imagine this requires communication and transparency with your senior, regular check-ins and understanding what they are trying to achieve in their role. You don't need to bring anyone down to go up. I recognise that your co-worker might not be great but that's for your boss to see. If I were you I'd focus on weekly check-ins where I tell my boss what I've done in the past week to make his/her life easier and get an idea of what more I could do the following week to help. And in between slip in a session where you say that you want the promotion (you have to ask for it- if you don't ask you don't get because people might assume that you don't want more responsibilities) and put forward your case as to why you deserve it. If you need more help feel free to drop me a message and we can go through some exact scripts that you can take to your boss. (I cover such career tips on my blog and also send emails to my list.

In fact, I think most people would say they've done this at least 1x in their life.  So if that's you, I wouldn't beat yourself up about it.  You're there now, so make the most of it.  Learn alot, contribute, build others up, and see what good you can do while you're there.  But I would caution you against jumping jobs again so soon.  Ride it out, assuming your ethics aren't being comprised and when you're truly ready to change again, just make sure that next transition is the real deal and you're doing it for the right reasons."

Make sure that everything is ready for a new employee. If they need a badge to gain access in/out of their work area, put that on the top of the list.

If they need logins/passwords to access their workstation, have that all ready for them before they sit down at their desk. Also provide all other logins/passwords for applications they need to use so they can get started setting up their station without having to ask for this information every 10 minutes.

Make a list of people in their team, a list of managers in their area, and give them access to the org structure, if it exists. It's very hard to remember the names of people you just met, but having a list will make that process easier.

Make sure to go around with the employee and point out all the important features of your building. Washrooms, eating areas, workout areas, leisure areas, and so on. Make sure they know if certain areas are off-limits. For instance, the board room, or whatever. 

Introduce them to the desktop support team and tell them how to create support tickets, or how to escalate issues in general when they encounter them. 

These are all things I've seen in my workplace, and instead of HR making sure they are done, it falls upon team members to show the new employee. It just looks unorganized and unprofessional."

,,TypicalRookieMistake,,,,,"**Long Comment Warning:**

I have been in search of someone in this same situation. I'm not sure I have an exact answer, but I will share my thoughts and maybe you can extract something from it. 

First of all, I am an account executive for a television station. In short I sell advertising to small and large businesses. Not to sound self-centered, but I am also doing well because I am obsessed with advertising and marketing and I genuinely care about my clients' success. My billing has doubled a couple of times since joining the company about 8 months ago. HOWEVER...the market I sell in is very small. I am sick of the town I live in and I have recently decided to completely uproot my life, travel for 8-15 months and then upon my return transition to a new city and seek a new job. 

I am in the same boat because my trip is in September and I must remain in the job until August (to fulfill my apartment lease and continue to save). With this trip on the horizon and so much planning going into said trip, I have completely lost my spark to sell, work...do anything at work. I literally feel like a zombie with no ambition and it makes me feel very guilty because of how much I want my clients to succeed and the friendships I have developed at work.

**You are definitely NOT ALONE in this situation.** 

The only thing I can say is try and find happiness and motivation in the little things while at work and remember it's only a little while longer that you have to stay, so have faith in the future and stay strong. Also, focus on gearing up for the next situation, your next move...find an escape in it, so you're mind is occupied on off hours and you are not wasting energy on the stress your current situation is causing. *The truth is, you're not going to somehow dredge up some motivation, you already have a foot out the door (in your mind at least). You have to accept that you will be going through the motions in your final days.*"

This is for the typical lab tech job, if you want something specific to PH i can't help, but probably its the same, you need to start at the bottom in an academic setting, given your experience.

,,CuriousKid_T,,,,,"Hey!

First off you must know, we all go through this. It‚Äôs not difficult to get caught up in the race of aging.

You were an Internal Auditor and now you plan to get into something completely different. Understood!

But first, why do you want to change?
1. Is it money, status, or no opportunities in the field?
2. Why programming? Is it cause it‚Äôs got more scope?

Considering the second point, you may not want to jump into system analysis cause that would land you in IT but not into a programming job.

If the reason for your career switch is any one of the reasons from point one, you may want to explore other career options that have a similar ring to Internal Auditing.

I could understand your Reddit post but what I don‚Äôt get it why would you want to take a drastic change at this juncture?

You may want to reconsider and move forward.

Hope this helps! Cheers. üòä"

I mean, I'm not really that good of a programmer but given that in my experience as an internal auditor where we also made flowcharts (so similar to ERD), I think that that fits the job as well (as a Systems Analyst).

Reason as to why I wont pursue being an Internal Auditor is because here in my country (Philippines), there's this discrimination that if you are not an accounting graduate and a certified public accountant, you are frowned upon even though in the government manual, IT is desired as an auditor. Its just so discouraging to the point that I also tried to apply as a Senior Auditor (having 2 years and 7 months already  as an Internal Auditor), I was met with the same responses. It really wasnt about the competition per se, but it was about the discrimination. "

,,stressedtfo,,,,,"A Career is built through a combination of experience, education and effort. That is the only way to build a successful career. 

You are in a predicament where you need to dig yourself out of a hole before you can even get to the first step. Your focus should be on accepting any job offered, saving and getting your license back. 
You need to create a solid work history of being reliable, motivated and responsible. You do that by doing your very best at whatever job you take. You work that job for a solid 6 months to a year and save every penny that doesn‚Äôt go towards repaying debt or legal fees. 

Once you are caught up and your student loans are no longer in collections either by getting a payment plan or paying them off completely then you can focus on getting an education.

While pursuing your education, you use college or tech school resources to help you find an entry level job in your field. You work that job while simultaneously going to school. 

Receiving your education, having a solid work history and networking will give you leverage to pursue positions that lead to a career. 

There is no easy or quick way to achieving this.  This is the only path that leads to where you want. 

You must come to the realization that you are starting from the bottom (rock bottom) and you must work hard for the next 5 years to get yourself back on track. If you do this than you should be in a stable career by 42 years old. Sooner if you‚Äôre able to work your ass off. "

I would start by making a list of the things you've accomplished in your five years - projects you've taken on, leadership roles you've tackled, results you've gained for the company, etc. Include examples from the last year, and from work you did before your new manager took over, so that your new manager is aware of the breadth of your contributions. 

Then, get in a good mental space before your meeting. You don't want to come across as accusatory or defensive, but it's good to want to know more about your performance as well as where you're headed. Ask clear, concise questions, and keep yourself as the focus, rather than your manager. ""What is the ongoing structure for growth and career development? What tasks and responsibilities could I be managing that I'm not currently doing? How can I best contribute to the team?""

Use the conversation to gauge whether you should consider a move, or if you think this new team structure can still be worked into something productive and rewarding for you. Try to keep an open mind, even though it's a frustrating conversation.

My boss said something to the effect of ""I'm very happy to have you where you are because you do your job really well and it is very convenient for me to have you in that position.""

,,xephon81,,,,,"As I've continued to advance and get to more senior level positions, I've been micro-managed less and less and that also applies to taking time off. Now that I work on projects that have fairly long timelines, I tend to know when there will be lulls and when it is ""all hands on deck"". I schedule my PTO around these periods at my discretion and my manager trusts that I won't be taking a 2 week vacation a month before the estimated conclusion of a project or at the beginning when all the planning takes place.

&#x200B;

I think so long as you are aware of when you need to be in the office and when taking a week or two off won't affect your deliverables you should be fine. You are absolutely right in that they give you three weeks off for a reason and if you aren't supposed to take them, then why give them to you in the first place? This is especially true if you live in a state where vacation does not roll over year to year - that's money you are throwing away if you don't take those days!

&#x200B;

That being said, some company cultures and even worse, direct managers frown upon taking extended time off even though there is no ""official"" policy regarding it. In these cases, the phrase ""employees don't quit companies, they quit managers"" come to mind. My take has always been if I'm fulfilling my job duties and producing tangible results and benefits, taking time off shouldn't be scrutinized; if all that is true, and management is still getting upset, then I have to make a decision whether it's a culture or manager I want to continue to work under, or am I going to go somewhere that more closely aligns with what I consider a great work/life balance.

Want to take a trip? Rest assured that you can afford it and will still get paid in your time off.

Want to live life by going to a concert? Buy tickets without worrying about where the money will come from...hell buy a VIP package to see your favorite artist up close!

Want to spend more time with your family? A good job could give you access to on-site day care, allow you to pay for someone to take care of the minutiae around your house, and create opportunities for you to give your children.

It's hard to grasp while you're in college. I remember when $20-40 would last me all weekend, and I'd have a blast just ""living"" but the real world runs on money, and to get money you need a job, and to be able to do the things you want to do with money you need MORE money, and you get money by having a good job.

I work a great job that I love, but it takes up a 9-5 slot in my life, with a 15 minute commute door-to-desk each way. When I come home every night I don't ever think about work.

...I'm only 31, and I got here by grinding for the first part of my 20's. I sacrificed time (and my liver) to lay groundwork for a solid career that is now paying off.

A job is NOT a goal, it's a vehicle. And just like a vehicle, the vehicles that go the furthest are the ones that are best maintained and cared for.

Invest the time early in your career in figuring out what it is you want to do, and finding out what you're good at, and let it pay off for years to come.

The alternative, of just ""living"", will leave you permanently behind your peers, and you'll never be able to catch up.  You can always choose to coast later, but you can never choose to catch up once your decision is made."

All I can recommend is that you shadow some nurses first.  I work as a staff nurse in a large hospital and it is *grueling*.  12 hour shifts in 99% of the hospital jobs.   And the degree isn‚Äôt easy, although it is likely very doable as you‚Äôve already earned a phd...

The 12s can be nice if it works for your lifestyle, but for me, I have no work life balance and have to have at least a full day to recover after a few in a row.

It is rewarding though, but incredibly stressful physically, mentally and emotionally.  I‚Äôve been a nurse for 27 years, and some of the brand new nurses are like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do this job much longer‚Äù.

,,Tealplates6,,,,,"My Junior year of high school, I had a history teacher who said he used to be in sales and made great money, had the nice cars, clothes, etc...but he wasn't happy so he left and pursued being a teacher. He was very enthusiastic and always had a smile on his face - it was more than obvious that he really did enjoy what he did and all the students loved him because he wanted to be there and in turn, they wanted him there. He also had a wife and two children and things worked out for them. 

A couple years ago, I was recently out of school and in a job that I absolutely hated so I found another....only to to find out that I hated this new job even more. I got no respect or support from my colleagues and I knew I couldn't spend any more time in a job that I hated. I walked out after three months, with no job lined up for the sake of my happiness. Granted, I lived at home with my parents so I had a safety net  for the time being. I was blessed with parents who have been supportive of anything I do if it makes me happy. I will never forget what my dad told me, ""if you feel disrespected then leave and don't look back."" Sometimes, people who care about you don't care how much you can offer or what your credentials are but more so about how well you take care of yourself and your happiness. In my opinion, if you are miserable at work, you will be miserable at home and I don't think your wife and child would want that because it will negatively rub off on them, as well. Since I don't know your family, I can't be 100&#37; certain when I say this but I will assume that they want the best for you. If this is the best option for you, I don't think they see you as failure.

Just as a side note to let you know how things ended up working out for me, leaving that job was the best thing I could have done for my career. I found a job (within a month of walking out of my other one - I was unemployed and they knew that) that better aligned with who I was and what I wanted to do. After being there for a year and half, I gained more valuable and relevant skills, moved up to higher level position in the largest organization in my city, and doubled my salary. I bought myself a new car, condo, and have opened so many doors for myself in my new career. I know the sky is the limit for me. You may only be making $22.00 an hour NOW but if you continue to dedicate yourself and honestly follow your heart, I think you will surprise yourself with how far you will go - maybe one day, you will be the CEO of a facility. 

Good luck to you! "

Sales and marketing seemed to have the most fun. I also saw sales where under these short term high pressure targets and marketing weren't. From there it took a couple years but I managed to transition into marketing.

Now in my late 30's I realise marketing isn't the best career to grow old in. So considering options for career path 3 before she becomes a possible issue...

Personally I'd avoid looking for what you are passionate about as a primary factor. Don't get me wrong, enjoyability is a factor as above but 'passion for your work' is such a American thing. Look for a career that pays well, is reasonably secure, lets you move outside major cities as this is likely through life and something you age well in. Then something you won't hate. But really job enjoyability in my experience is as much about the people around you than the work itself.

Passion can be found feeling secure in relaxing with your friends, family and hobbies.

I am now in month 7 and have not been converted. You get a sense of whether or not you'll be converted after the first couple of months. I enjoy what I do. I enjoy who I work with. I am now looking for other opportunities both within the same company for a permanent role and beyond. I used this role as a stepping stone to ground myself and figure out my next move.

,,TikoFreya,,,,,"After time you'll find your threshold. I've commuted for many years with drives of 20 mins to 1:10. My threshold is right at 40 minutes. Anything further becomes grueling. Just like another poster mentioned, with the longer commute you'll basically be driving, making food, or sleeping. It can be a huge adjustment (it certainly was for me after graduating) and can honestly be hard to balance against the life you 'want' to lead. 

That said, being employed and having experience all make you more hireable. It sounds like this could be a great opportunity, so if it were me I'd take it. After a few months just start looking around for a permanent role that's a bit closer... and if you can't find anything you still have the potential to become permanent at the current role.

I accepted the job right after the interview and had a week before the start date. My grandmother was the closest relative so I lived with her. I moved about a week ago to be closer to work and friends. But look at me now, looking for companies further away so I have a commute again. SMH"

,,TheCodesterr,,,,,"Hey long time no talk. I was the guy talking about the commute to my new job. I've been driving there a couple weeks now. The drive isn't too bad but I'm learning new stuff and have to take tests and what not. 

Overall, it's really hard for me to pay attention because making calls, troubleshooting their tech stuff (it's chick Fil a corp.) such as registers, monitors, receipt printers etc isn't really that interesting tbh. 

I feel like the only one in the class that drifts and doesn't pay attention. I failed my first cert exam by one point and have to take it again at home. If I don't pass with 70 or higher I'm done they said. I have to study more this weekend. There was one person in my class that failed with me. It's really discouraging tbh. 

We took another assessment yesterday learning new things and barely got by with an 85 (that's what we need to stay). We will be taking more assessments and I will need to continue to pass with 85 or higher.

I'm honestly not interesting in taking calls and troubleshooting. I like fixing things, but idk about this. I'm going to keep trying though and not give up. But man I'm stressed and have a lot of anxiety lol. 

It's all good though. I think I need to take it more seriously. 

Thought I'd update you since you asked haha!"

,,old-father,,,,,"Pretty open-ended question.  I think that if you want to make a lot of money quickly, it's hard to beat being an investment banker on Wall Street.  It is also hard to get a job as an investment banker on Wall Street.  They are usually from Ivy League schools.   But, maybe y ou can swing that.  You also need a connection.   You also must be willing to be abused by your employer.   From what I have read, it is brutal.

What is your current situation so we can give you some useful advice.  Are you in or planning to go to college?  What is enough money to retire for you?  By what age?  

Also, learn about the magic of compound intetest.  When you're young and single, be as frugal as possible. Invest everything you can.  When you are older, saving like that becomes much more difficult.

I could go on but it would help to have some context to your question.   I think it's a great question.

Too many people try to be too cerebral with finding a career.  Careers are visceral!

Sometimes you will think you know exactly what you want to do in life (I've thought that no fewer than 3 times in my life) but when you actually try doing what it is you think you'd like, you find it's not for you.  Then you're trapped since you've invested so much time convincing yourself this is the right move and you want to make it pay off.

Instead, just get out the door and try jobs.  Try enough jobs and your career will start to take shape.  If you would have told me, in college, that I would be doing what I am now, I wouldn't have believed you, but I took chances, tried opportunities available to me, and was willing to cut my losses and move on to the next thing when I realized I didn't like what I was doing.

,,,,,,,"Lol! This is classic. 

PS - you might have some undiagnosed autism. "
,,MariyaAIP,,,,,"Yes. All the customer needed to know was that someone is currently using the restroom, not that someone from staff was using it or that they should be told to hurry up. Almost no one enjoys being publicly embarrassed.

Yes, the write-up is enough punishment but your lack of tact has burned your bridge with the DM.

Judging by your attitude (asking if it was bad), you probably haven't apologized to her or tried to make it up her. I would recommend doing so if you want to get on her good side again sooner rather than later... or never."
,,dark_angel1720,,,,,"Isn't a write up enough punishment? Why does my direct supervisor have to hate me as a person? She ignores me and cut my hours. Doesn't even want me around anymore. 

Back when she liked me, she used to schedule me shitload of hours and even call me in. She also used to be nice. Now every time she says anything to me, it's with anger."
,,dark_angel1720,,,,,I was just trying to help the customer. What I'm not understanding is why my supervisor just stopped liking me and wrote me up. She even knew I wasn't doing anything bad intentionally. It's been a few days now.
,,dark_angel1720,,,,,I used to think anyone could have made this mistake. Guess I'm wrong.
,,Ysrw,,,,,"I understand that you didn't mean to do something bad and your intentions were good. However, bathroom time can be embarrassing and the rule of thumb in polite society is to always be discreet. You did the opposite of that, which is considered a big no no. 

The customer was embarrassed because of the scene you made on her behalf. She would have just waited for the bathroom if you simply said someone was in there. 

You embarrassed the district supervisor by letting everyone know SHE was in the washroom. If you knew she was in there you should leave her alone unless there's like, a fire. If the customer didn't say it was an emergency, then you have no reason to disturb the supervisor during her time in the washroom. It's nobody's business to disturb or hurry someone out of the washroom in this situation. 

So in trying to help a customer, you actually embarrassed the customer, embarrassed &harassed  the supervisor in front of the whole store, and managed to disturb the customers on the floor. This is why you got written up and everyone is mad. 

I don't mean to sound super harsh, because I can see how someone might not understand the social situation easily. I think your heart was in the right place, but your actions lead to a bad embarrassment for everyone involved that was totally unnecessary. 

If you're worried about people not liking you for this, and want them to forgive you, you need to demonstrate that you understand why you were wrong, and how you will avoid this in the future. In future, always act with discretion in these situations. I would talk to your supervisor and explain you didn't understand what you did wrong at first but now you do and it won't happen again. "

,,terpaderp,,,,,"Depends on where you are in the ""Research"" stack. All that data is coming from somewhere. In my experience a huge part of any R&D organization is having the do-ers who take nebulous research goals and turn them into achievable tests and representative data. So one side is finding applicable standards for measurement that you can leverage, the other is looking for gaps in existing equipment and figuring out what else needs to be measured that no one else is looking at yet. The deeper you are in the research side the greater the need for custom tests and equipment, which means people who understand the research need well enough to balance the information needed to make a decision versus the cost of getting that information.

All of this to say that research could be sitting at your computer and analyzing someone else's data all data all day, but it can also mean a lot of hands on work making that science happen."

,,samudrin,,,,,"why are you interested in PT?  Have you talked to any PTs about what it is like in their line of work?  I think it would be an interesting field.

Can you bring your GPA up and work as a trainer (assisting the PTs with the client exercises?) on a part time basis to get exposure to the industry?"
,,PhoenixTears,,,,,"I think its an interesting career. I like the idea of developing plans to help people improve their body and deal with impairments. But no, i haven't done too much researh into it. I am hoping to volunteer in a rehab center. My problem is time. What should I do while researching?"
,,samudrin,,,,,"So I just calculated you would need 21.3 classes at a 4.0 to raise your GPA from 3.5 to 3.7. (I assumed you've average 3.5 over a 32 course load).  That's 2.75 years of full course load.  You could have a masters degree in that time.  So you shouldn't stay in undergrad just to boost your GPA.  3.5 is not bad.

Are there post grad programs that would accept you with a 3.5?  How about in the US or Europe?

As far as deciding what you want to do, what you want to do at 21 years will be different from what you want to do at 30, and then again at 40.  At least it has been for me.  So you don't have to make the ""best"" decision, you just need to make good decisions, or at least learn from the bad ones... haha

As far as getting into a new industry, you need to go out and meet people who work in it and talk to them to find out what it entails, nothing like first hand experience and direct contacts.  That kind of ""research"" you can do right away.  Walk down to your local PT and say hi I was hoping to talk to one of your PTs when they had a free moment (or call ahead).  Have you had an injury where you had to go through PT?  Can you call your old PT up and chat with them?

As far as grad school that could be a good option, if you don't saddle yourself with lots of student loan debt, or if you are relatively certain you want to pursue a specific career path.

You also mention sonograph, respiratory therapist - go talk to these people too.  Explore all your options.

If you live in a town with literally no jobs, consider moving to one of the major cities, there's more commerce and stuff happening in general, do it while your young and it is easy to adapt.  Plus you get to meet new people that way.

Congrats on completing your BSc.  That's already a step ahead of a liberal arts degree / BA.  What kind of science did you study?

Masters are good but I do not like research and i heard masters usually result in being overqualified. I guess I could look into PT in the states. I dont know any PTs personally.

I know, meeting people and getting experience is imp...its just that applications are due in little over a month. Thanks! Your advice was very helpful. I studied Physiology and Health and Disease. "
Changing to an IT career?,1637z28,Casi_amanece,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/1637z28/changing_to_an_it_career/,3,15,1693184935.0,
,,TheBobInSonoma,,,,,"As ex-IT with 25 yrs in the field first, it's not as stable as you think as the technology is always changing and you'll have yesterday's skills. That's why when you see IT folks they're usually about 30+-. I stuck around longer by going less technical, s/w project mgt. Eventually that went to Asia at a much lower salary. Second, being hired into a tech job without the tech skills likely won't happen. It's not just programming, but networks, security, cloud computing, database mgt, and others. In a large company you might get by with just one of those skills. That is, you're going to need some technical classes to have a chance."
,,TechFiend72,,,,,"A few things. IT and development aren't aligned but not the same thing.

It is VERY hard to start programming at 30. Things change super rapidly and you are constantly learning new frameworks every six months. Is this what you really want to do? Why do you want to write code?

IT is infrastructure and technology architecture/engineering/support/etc. It is the backbone of how everything runs. You can do this at 30. Get your A+ certification and go work on an MSP helpdesk. Then pick up Net+ and Sec+. Move into projects. Become a systems admin. Then engineer. Then move to a different company that is less hire on fire sort of place.

My son is 29 and is doing the second path.

Any other questions, we are happy to provide guidance."
,,Old-Man-Withers,,,,,"From what I see & hear, the IT market is oversaturated.  Unless you have something unique and outstanding above the 1000+ other applicants, you are going to have a tough time no matter what path in IT you decide on."
,,420shaken,,,,,"I would say there is an oversaturation in certain markets but certainly widespread.  Really kind of depends on what you are willing to do and where.  Programmers are a dime a dozen, especially since work from home exploded into the scene because of Covid.  Now instead of competing against 25 applicants, it's more like 2500.  If you want a more hands on approach, like onsite tech support, sky is the limit based on your area and salary reqs.  IMO, beginning IT is a lot like being an electrician in a way that, you begin as a journeyman, sort of a low paid intern.  Hopefully you don't mind making near minimum wage to learn the ropes for like 24 months.  You will be competing against the younger ones eager to get a job and no issues with lower pay, temporarily. Decide early to be a master of one or a jack of all trades type of IT.  I would actually suggest the healthcare or banking industry as there is always a need and the pay is middle of the road.  Certifications are nice, but don't mean crap if you don't actually know the content.  Many just cram and get by and some are really easy to get, even ""open book"" style.   
Bottom line, get in it because it's what you want to do and it may make you happy.  Do not do it because it looks easy or for the money.  It is rarely either of those."
,,TerribleTodd60,,,,,"So, it all depends on how you want to chart your path.  This is what I'd do if I were in your position (and I was many years ago) . Don't quit your day job but start by learning how to code.  You don't have to be the worlds greatest programmer to do entry level stuff.  Just take a year, take some classes at a community college to get your feet wet and learn how to code.  

But really spend a lot of time investing in learning during that year. Push yourself, develop some apps.  It doesn't matter if they are great, go through the dev life cycle a couple of times on your own on project that don't really matter. 

Next, still in your opening year, start coding in non professional ways but share your code with pros.  Work on a game mod, put together a git profile, do something that gets your code out in the world.  Share your code with the dev gurus in your community college classes.  Get pro feedback.  Also, look at their code.  How does yours compare?  why do they do the things they are doing?  

Now, you are ready to take a little project from an online market place.  I work with Upwork but there are plenty of market places where you can find work.  Go get a little project.  Do a great job on that project.  There is more to being a successful software developer than coding.  Don't neglect the soft skills.  Customer service, good profession reputation, these are the skills that can separate you from your peers that an interviewer will be able to pick up on.  Put together a little portfolio of work. 

Now, a couple of gig projects under your belt,  A sound foundation in programming, your tech interviewers are going to care a lot more about that those things than where you got your degree or how old you are.  Also, you can try programming before you spend lots of money to learn how to do it.  It will take a lot of personal initiative but getting into the field as fast as you ethically can and subject your skill set to the scrutiny of paid work is really the best way. Good luck"
,,Ok-Abbreviations9936,,,,,"Not trying to be a downer here, but a few things to worry about. 

No one is hiring devs right now with no experience. You need some basic 101 knowledge to get entry level. If you show up with nothing, you are wasting your time.

Opening your own business is good for the right kind of person. That said, do not open your own dev business with no dev knowledge. This will not be a shortcut to get around the hiring process and required training. Your company will have no value to offer. 

Also, as others have mentioned. IT career and Dev careers are related, but generally separate. Most think sysadmin, cybersecurity, and networking as IT, and devs as their own little split off.  The only connection is your departments may report to the same VP or exec. 

Finally, yes the dev market is flooded right now. Do not expect to get remote work. The best in the country are apply for the available remote positions. Your best bet is to get in locally."
,,Casi_amanece,,,,,"Ok, I understand. Sounds complicated to learn all that. I am just a bit disappointed of my unstable job. But it would probably be easier to try to get another job."

,,AnonOfEmber,,,,,"Most big insurance companies have really good training AND will pay for you to go to school while you work for them. Warning: they probably will work you to death BUT if you‚Äôre looking for a 9-5 that will train you AND pay you to go to school, big name insurance companies are a good find. 

My mom is an accountant with a big insurance company and I actually got an interview for an entry level job. I didn‚Äôt get that job BUT they‚Äôre currently in the process of adding more jobs to their departments and have told my mom once they get all the details and descriptions set up that I‚Äôll be first in line to get any of those jobs. 

I‚Äôve worked in retail for almost 6 years now and have a high school diploma so I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from.

If you‚Äôre looking for cheap ways to get a leg up in the job market, udemy has some really good courses for different office application. I‚Äôve been taking a udemy course for all the widely used Microsoft applications (excel,word,office) that includes exercises so you can practice yourself. It was only $20 and I looked over the course before I bought it you just gotta glance at the details to get a quality course (price, ratings, how MANY times it‚Äôs been rated).

***LinkedIn is also a really good way to network yourself into a new job. If you don‚Äôt have an account already, make one and start connecting with people and making posts! Some companies will actually post about hiring people with less education to hire and train and contact people on LinkedIn if they can see your experience and what kind of work you‚Äôre looking for in your bio. I just have ‚Äúopen to new connections‚Äù and opportunities in mine!"
,,Something_morepoetic,,,,,"I suggest looking at the community college again.  Ask about grants and financing options. Look at short term certificates that help you qualify for entry into a new career. Their employment and job placement offices can offer career assessment and counseling. Also, U.S. colleges receive grants for training in specific industries so that the cost to students is low to nothing. This is more for the trades, so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre looking for. Cyber security is a growing field right now as is health care. Good luck! 
Edit: forgot to mention many courses are online, which can save time for people with busy schedules. For the best information, make an appointment with an advisor."
,,CreepInTheOffice,,,,,"I will throw a few out there. Hopefully, one of them can interest you.

No prior relevant experience or education required:

* Funeral Homes - I had a friend who worked as a funeral home salesman. He made A LOT of money even in his first year just selling funeral solutions to people. Depends on your jurisdiction, it's not a high pressure sales job and it's not shady and it's highly regulated. Generally, the families were very happy for him to help the process along. Funeral homes are hungry for young blood as many baby boomers retire. It was a genuinely a very satisfying career for him... until... ""stuff"" in his house started breaking or moving by themselves for no reason... that's when his orthodox upbringing got the better of his reasoning and switch jobs .
* Insurance broker/underwriter/claims rep - Not as lucrative as funeral home but insurance companies generally provide lots of on the job training and pays well. Entry level positions don't usually require a specialized education but it does if you are moving up the ladder. A broker sells insurance to the public; An underwriter sells insurance to the broker; A Claims rep process claims. Apparently, claims is the most stressful. I knew a lady who had a heart attack on the job when she was in her early 50s. But in general, insurance provides lots of upward career movement potentials.
* Microgreen farmer - (See local jurisdiction again) If you are feeling adventurous, start this as your side job. Grow microgreens or mushrooms to sell. Very tough, I hear. For clarity, I am not talking weird or illegal plants. I am talking about edible plants and mushrooms like the ones at the grocery store. 
* Property Management/Superintendent - Good if you have some experience with repairing stuff around the house. You have customer service experience already so that will be useful in this line of work. Not very well paid, I hear but it's worth a look if you want to run your own hotel/motel one day.
* Truck driver - I am hesitate to mention this one because of the low pay and poor working conditions but it's just an idea for you to bounce off of. Truck drivers are trained but they lock you in with debt. 

&#x200B;

As the other redditor have said, check your local community college for other career paths.

Good luck! I hope everything works out for you :)"

,,flip-joy,,,,,Easy to slip into depression in the aftermath. Make sure you‚Äôve got something to keep your interests up.
,,ObvslyNotAGolfer,,,,,"First of all, all the best to you in this new chapter.

I cannot give you particular advice regarding what is coming and the challenges you will encounter, because I haven't been in this situation yet. That being said, I can share a bit of my story and approach, hoping this can somehow help you. 

I've been shaping my team and, to a certain extent, my department for the past 6 years, and can relate quite directly to the feeling you referred to as ""full of guilt for walking away from something I have helped shape and of course my team"". I have considered a career switch a couple of times, and decided to stay mainly because of the people, the long term vision of my direct manager & some senior management, but also because I've always wanted to leave things in a much better place compared to when I joined.

Over the years, my team's performance and presence became intimately associated to my drive, involvement, vision and passion, but I have also developed the strong belief that no team should depend on a single person to move forward, and that I need to understand that they will be OK without me. The day I leave, there will certainly be an adaptation phase to the new ways of whoever will be in charge, but they will be just fine as they are capable and passionate people, but also because of the legacy one will leave behind.

Now, I don't know the particulars of your story in that regard, but I can safely bet that people will follow or be inspired by the things you have done, and even if they do not interpret that 100% accurately, they'll have their version of it, and adapt that to the new reality. Is it going to be ""as good"" or ""better""? Hard to say (or even impossible to measure), but you can rest assured they will be fine. You have done the best you could and giving the best of you, but you should not feel attached to the things you cannot control.

The stoic principle of focusing only on what you can control can hopefully help you move forward, and let that guilt fade away quicker,  more naturally and more definitely.

The next chapters are for you to fill and figure out, and that is actually a wonderful thing. Scary, but wonderful. Without pressure, the path will shape itself, so allow time to discover your new self, outside that known reality of the past decade and a half. And please remember that sometimes it's just alright to let the chips fall where they may.

Best of luck, be happy, be positive. Peace."

,,Wild_Emu7167,,,,,"You need at least a master degree in biology to start a career in the life science industry- the fact is about 70% of all the life science labor force has at least a masters degree-- with just a BS degree you will be fighting an up hill battle with an anvil around your neck.

According to an the analysis by the Foundation For Research and Equal Opportunity that looked at 30,000 degree programs and IRS data - it found that Those that graduated with a Bs in biology and did not get further education  are financially worse off then HS graduates- A whopping 31% will actually have  a NEGATIVE return on investment then some one that just got a HS diploma and went to work....  Biology is the 3rd worst degree out of the 50 majors they examined- Only ART and Theology had worse financial outcomes--

even Ziprecruiter ranked biology as the 9th most regretted major ( tied with english ) and the only science degree in the top 10 place---

Your only option is to go back to school--- however i would advice thinking twice about getting a masters in biology as 50% of those with masters in biology are UNDER-employed( working mc jobs)--- there is simply not enough jobs and too many life science graduates flooding the labor market----

BTW try looking to Clinical Research Coordinator positions-- youll use 0% of your biology degree- but it is 'research'-- and it can open the door to working at a pharma company.

good luck"
,,Exotic_Lobster_1399,,,,,At major research universities they have trouble attracting lab technicians sometimes. I would check to see if one of those is feasible. But I agree with the above comments.

,,DigitalNomadNapping,,,,,"Biology is a fascinating field of study with so many potential applications. One obvious option would be to pursue a career in the life sciences or healthcare industries. For example, you could consider becoming a research scientist, a lab technician, a microbiologist, a biotechnologist, a medical writer, or an environmental scientist. You could also look into options in the agricultural sector, conservation and environmental management, or the food and beverage industry. There are also non-traditional options you could consider, like patent law, science communication, or science journalism."

,,ImmortanDrew,,,,,"Not sure where you live, but the US government has a pathways program for recent graduates where you're eligible for 2 years upon your degree being conferred.  A bachelor's would start you at a GS-07, but you get a promotion every year until you reach the full performance level of the job (typically a GS-12).  And the GS scale is a little wonky, so it would be a year at 07, a year at 09, a year at 11, then you'd be a 12.  And if you're a performer, a GS-13 is almost guaranteed.  In my locality, a GS-12 starts mid 90k, plus all the federal government benefits.  Check out usajobs.gov."

There's a ton of avenues to transition from a govt job to civilian, and a lot of places who want people with management experience.  12 years at a single place speaks volumes to a hiring manager.  If you're happy with pay and looking at things like ""am I happy here"" and ""does my role have a future"" then you're in a good place in terms of really defining yourself and what you want.  I was there too maybe 10 years ago, lucky enough to have a manager I loved who funded a coach, who really steered me to what I want in a role, in a career, what gave me energy and what took it away, growing my confidence and ownership.  I took what I learned and moved around every few years, trying new things and enjoying every step... until I'd get bored and look for the next opportunity.

,,Monkey_Bullet,,,,,"Sorry, the hard truth is that unless you push for a change, things will always stay the same way. You'll need to have a challenging conversation with upper management and HR.

Sitting there, hoping things will get better and doing nothing will change nothing."
,,TowMater66,,,,,"A couple of thoughts.
First, keep looking for another job. Continue to seek the light at the end of the tunnel you are in and don‚Äôt give up on your self and take care of yourself first.  Second, management is hard but it doesn‚Äôt have to suck the life out of you. You may be putting more pressure on yourself than your supervisor intends.  A good discussion with them is in order.  Let them know how you feel.  Spend some mental time identifying the key elements of your work that overwhelm you, and address those with your supervisor, they may have insight.  If they don‚Äôt, that also means something. Third, dial it back. Management doesn‚Äôt mean controlling everything all the time or being part of every conversation. Take some losses and learn where the lines really are. It‚Äôs ok, you don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Best of luck!"
,,Obdami,,,,,"Probably.  I've hated just about every job I've ever had because they are jobs that I had to do and not ones that I wanted to do.  I dunno, being a wage slave is likely an inherently crap deal.

I was watching an old documentary recently about the banality of life in the early 60s.  They interviewed dudes working on assembly lines and god it was heart wrenching to hear their despair and how stuck they were, what with a wife and kids at home and now way to progress beyond their current situation.  

Can you imagine?  Hour after hour, day after day, putting part A into slot B, over and over and over.  God...how'd they do it?  They just did, no choice.  And that sucks."
,,yes420420yes,,,,,"You have not really written what makes this management job so bad ?  


Yes, management in government means its almost impossible to fire bad people, BUT you can make their life unpleasant (at a cost to you), you can help them transfer out, you can learn to sweet talk them into doing what you actually want them to do (that's a skill that comes in very handy anywhere), you can slice and dice the work to make it more fun....lots of angles to take here and some are indeed the sign of a good manager vs someone that has little clue.

Have you asked for management training courses ? Is there a supervisor you can discuss with openly ? Are there ways for you to advance further up the chain fast ? Do you have a chance to apply for programs/grants/additional projects and people (so you dilute the ones that are a PITA and can pick better ones) ?

If you really think its not a match with you, then get out and get back to your original job - its better to be bored then stressed - boredom can be filled with interesting things....and since the money is not a deciding factor at all I would purely look at the 'fun factor' and 'future development posisbilities'.

You can still look for other jobs when you are back in your old position. I will also mention that you are in an age range of midlife crisis...maybe something to think about if some of this is not actually 'just' a general search for meaning in life....and there is a plethora of books to study for that. 

On the plus side, you learned that management in government is really not for you, so look at what other specialized job you can do with the experience set you have (or can additionally acquire) - there is strength in knowing what you can and can not do."

If an interview was going really well, I‚Äôd even push to the point of asking what kind of position I would need to be in to make that kind of money in their company.  That will tell you if this is the company, or if the position is achievable."

Look you do you. It seems to be clearly weighing on you as all of the above text has nothing to do with the journey to 250 - that has everything to do with a fall from grace, financial mismanagement that probably caused a lot of harm to your relationship.

If you don't feel that is the case, thats fine, you do you. Not interested in convincing you of anything or getting in to it."
,,Progresschmogress,,,,,"What you quoted is literally the stuff that happened on the way to just below 200, and then between that and the 250 mark and beyond which is precisely what OP asked for

The 401K bit was not mismanaged by her, it was an actively managed account by a vanilla financial institution that she called out for one year of subpar performance so she took that over; so I‚Äôm super puzzled right now as how you can take the story of someone becoming financially independent by literally being good at stock trading as financial mismanagement?

I‚Äôm still trying to find anything that could be seen as a fall from grace in what you quoted lol"

Any advice on telling my bosses boss that he‚Äôs unorganized and hard to work for?,14ezhnq,ventingin2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/14ezhnq/any_advice_on_telling_my_bosses_boss_that_hes/,5,43,1687328380.0,

,,Environmental-Bar-39,,,,,You will be told that you could have made up the slack where your manager had issues and will be on his shit list for complaining.
,,kdmfa,,,,,"Tread lightly. That type of convo could blow up in your face, especially if you‚Äôre instigating it. It‚Äôs possible some of the issues are driven by the person you‚Äôre speaking with (eg change in priorities/requests) but you don‚Äôt have visibility. They could have an extremely good relationship and this person has no relationship with you. You could ask your skip manager about what the team is doing well vs what the team could improve on and then figure out how to focus on those important areas. If the skip asks how the manager is doing, be very diplomatic (think about how you‚Äôll respond before going into the convo) and try to think of any good examples and maybe you can add one area where you want them to improve most. For example, they doing x, y, and z great but one area they could improve is _. 

Are there performance reviews where you review your manager? If so, that‚Äôs one avenue for bringing up issues.

Regardless if there are reviews or not, you need to ensure you clearly communicate your feedback (tricky to be diplomatic I‚Äôm sure) to your manager. They may not be aware of what they are doing or the negative consequences. Start with the worst offense (causing biggest negative consequences/happening most frequent) and work through it before piling on. 

One idea is to create/ask to create a centralized tracker for all requests. Say that your manager that you have trouble tracking all requests and what‚Äôs most important and that you think having a central place to track when something was asked, what it was, it‚Äôs priority and the progress would be helpful for you and your team."

,,Charm534,,,,,"DO NOT point out your Boss‚Äôs failings to his Boss, he is already painfully aware and working on it. This action risks making your management team your adversary. For career development and advancement, your Boss must be your advocate, and you should be theirs by managing up. If you make an adversarial relationship, consider your career at this place damaged, if not done. This type of stuff is in every workspace, learn how to deal with it without throwing your Boss under the bus, and shaming his Boss in the process."
,,,,,,,"Maybe if there‚Äôs feedback to give you should man up and give that to your boss.  Everyone deserves that respect.  If he‚Äôs as nice as you say than have the conversation about why it‚Äôs been challenging.  

Going above his head is asking for your immediate boss to not trust you ever again and could put you on the express path to having the pendulum swing all the way to the other side and you being micromanaged to death until you can‚Äôt stand it and leave."
,,belagrim,,,,,"You have stated yourself that this person does not believe that there is an issue, and you have already addressed this behavior with them.

Continuing to do so will only hurt you.  Makes it seem that you simply cannot adapt.

So: the answer is adapt.

Introduce an internal scrum or agile process.  Don't include the bosses but track the requested work through that.  Let them ask to be included.

You do not need the boss to change, you need the issues caused by your boss to no longer effect you.  This is the way.

Sounds like regardless of these issues it is a good place and work does get done?  Your bosses boss did have something to do with creating that environment...."
,,LingLingMang,,,,,"That‚Äôs a difficult spot‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs always been my motto to address something with a person first prior to going above that person. I honestly would not bring up any of this to my bosses boss without discussing it with my boss personally first. It is unfair to the person to address something that has never been brought to their attention to see if they can resolve those issues before going above their head.
What I would definitely do, is bring up that you have been going above and beyond in the things you listed above and have successfully executed under pressure of a last minute. I would try to build a relationship with him that he can trust you, And know you are there for the company. If you have any ideas how to better the workplace, I would not hold back from discussing it with him, time I would not make boss look bad.

If it‚Äôs possible to move positions, I‚Äôd definitely say how you‚Äôre struggling with this boss and would like to explore your options. When the bosses boss asks why, be short with the examples and only say a few. You don‚Äôt want to pile too many complaints because a lot of times, higher ups will also see you negatively. It‚Äôs dumb but that‚Äôs how they think sometimes and I wouldn‚Äôt risk it."
,,Fun_Apartment631,,,,,"I read Extreme Ownership on the plane the other day.  Kind of par for books of its type but it has some great stuff in the FAQ.  (Interpret great however you like.  üòâ)  Including how to deal with weak leadership.  Glue is also a good book, it's a little more earnest and has a much lower body count.  Also a little more specific.

Absolutely manage up.  Yeah, it can be more work than if your boss just tells you what to do and when to do it and it doesn't change.  Sorry.  ü§∑

It sounds like you're doing project-based work for outside customers.  At least outside your team.  You can get a lot of improvement out of using shared resources and driving their use.  At least 80% of your work should be against a ticket.  If you don't already have them, there are simple ticketing systems built into Teams and SharePoint, and more of them online.  You'll likely have to create your own tickets.  That's fine.  Also, keep them simple, they're just containers.  They need to be public, at least within your team and up your vertical.  If your boss is knowingly changing his mind and not just forgetting what he decided yesterday, having history would be good.  This is built in in Jira and SharePoint, probably others.

Ok.  Got tickets?  Great.  When you have meetings, put in a recap.  You can even take meeting notes straight to them.  Add tasks to them.  Including his.  All those different artifacts you mentioned generating?  Into the ticket.  When you have a meeting?  Have the ticket open.  Have a view showing all your tickets.  ""Should I be working on X or finish Y first"" is going to be a really frequent question if it's not already.

Oops, forgot why I mentioned Extreme Ownership - someone called into the podcast to ask how to cope with weak leadership.  The host says ""That's great!  Now you can define how you want to do your job."""
,,vegdeg,,,,,"I am a little concerned with you throwing the term gaslighting around....

Makes me question your account of other things.

Others are going to offer direct advice. I am going to challenge you to reflect on your own perception and presentation of events."
,,BeauTfulMess,,,,,"Oh no you don‚Äôt. This leads to disaster. If your boss is a problem, you need to talk to him directly before going to his boss.  Trust me, this is a mistake. Your boss‚Äôs boss may not like you being disloyal to your boss and for sure he‚Äôll tell your boss! What do you think will happen in best case scenario? Your boss will be fired?

,,ventingin2020,,,,,Not even lol. I have excellent performance reviews üòä not sure from what I stated where you got that from.

,,ventingin2020,,,,,"Anything I work on must be approved and or touched by my boss in some capacity. I‚Äôve created processes as I‚Äôve mentioned to try to adapt to this problem. If a person is unorganized and unwilling to be consistent with a process, how do I continue to adapt?"

,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I could, to be honest I love my job. My boss is the only issue. Our job should be exciting and fun but it requires organization and real work. My boss doesn‚Äôt believe in either of those and just likes to bs.

,,ventingin2020,,,,,"Unfortunately we are a very small team (three of us including him). I wish I could move to another boss, but he‚Äôs the only one for what we do. I also LOVE what I do, he just makes it extremely difficult and stressful when it‚Äôs an enjoyable role. 

I guess my goal in mentioning it, is to make him aware (esp since myself and my coworker have been thrown under the bus a few times). Also just to give advice on how to manage this as I feel I‚Äôve exhausted all avenues to keep things organized and smooth. To be frank, my boss doesn‚Äôt work and gets by, by being able to bs when leadership starts asking questions. He also ensures we stay very separate from leadership or cross functional partners as much as possible. Which then leads to us not having a clue as to what is going on as he doesn‚Äôt know nor would he ever rely the info to us in a coherent manner."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,I love this! Thank you!
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"An example of me being gaslit is my boss giving me a task to complete that I went through the details with him multiple times and had a witness. His boss questioned the task and why it was being done and instead of saying he told me to do it, he told his boss he didn‚Äôt know and would talk to me. He then told me he never told me to do said task. He was more afraid of disappointing his boss than taking accountability for something he in fact said. This happens frequently."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I already talked to my boss, multiple times, in writing."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I have. This has been going on over a year. I‚Äôve asked if I could help take anything off his plate and he tells me ‚Äúit‚Äôs honestly pretty quiet for him.‚Äù He‚Äôs a nice person, he‚Äôs not a good boss.

,,LiquidSoCrates,,,,,"Those performance reviews aren‚Äôt gonna mean anything if your boss feels like his back is against the wall.

,,LingLingMang,,,,,"Then you should speak with the bosses boss about it in a very soft and sensitive way.  See if you connect with this person.

Then say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bringing this up to reflect poorly on anyone, but ‚Ä¶______‚Äù and end it with something to the extent of ‚ÄòI just needed to get that off my chest.  I don‚Äôt know if you can assist with the situation.  I just don‚Äôt want him/her to get in trouble‚Äù"
,,iceyone444,,,,,"Could you develop a presentation on ideas of how to improve your department/the business and present it to your boss then his boss?

phrase it as streamlining/process improvement?"
,,vegdeg,,,,,"That is not gaslighting.

That is likely your boss having poor documentation and recall, especially if these convos happened on different days. Alternatively, that is them just throwing you under the boss.

This IS still bad behavior, reprehensible even, but not gaslighting."
,,BeauTfulMess,,,,,Did you talk to HR? A better step.
,,1645degoba,,,,,Then it is time to vote with your feet and look for a new job or position.
,,CrazyNext6315,,,,,"It really is. And it's my opinion that its unfair for them to expect you to work under these types of conditions. However, without knowing how your bosses' boss is going to react, you should tread very carefully. Vent to your friends, and express your frustrations at work in more ""professional"" ways. (Speak to the facts. Its okay to state that you are frustrated/feeling overwhelmed, etc, but try not to dramatize those emotions. Use adjectives like frequently or often instead of superlatives like always, never, etc.). Good Luck!"
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"My manager already acts in a way like his back is against the wall though lol. If his manager brings up anything he even senses may be negative, he shifts blame to myself and my counterpart. I agree with your last part about using his shortcomings to my advantage."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,That‚Äôs the plan. I‚Äôm going to mention all of the positives that my boss has and our team. I also intend on making this the smallest part of the conversation.
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I could, but I guess I‚Äôve asked him multiple times if there‚Äôs a process that could work better to stay organized and clear on strategy (with suggestions) and he‚Äôs said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no issue with the process‚Äù and I think he truly believes that lol. I also don‚Äôt think the suggestions I‚Äôve made and followed through with have changed his behavior. For example, recapping him throughly via email. He will acknowledge he received and then the next day ask me something that I clearly mentioned and or explained in the email (he‚Äôs not asking bc he didn‚Äôt understand but bc he either didn‚Äôt read the email and or forgot the recap I sent). I‚Äôve then literally screenshotted the recap and he‚Äôs like ok thanks! But never like oh yea, I forgot you sent me that. It‚Äôs just like the conversation never happened lol."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I see what you‚Äôre saying, but I don‚Äôt think this has anything to do with poor recall. I think he‚Äôs well aware he told me to do that, he just wants to convince me that he didn‚Äôt and thinks eventually I‚Äôll say ‚Äúmaybe I misheard‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe I misunderstood‚Äù which I‚Äôve done many times in the past. I‚Äôm no longer willing to do that or allow myself to be put in that position."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"I haven‚Äôt. I felt like that was overboard, but idk?

The talk with his boss went well. I complimented my boss and mentioned his positives, but just said what is currently going on is a pain point I would like to solve."
,,LingLingMang,,,,,"Smart, wish you the best!"
,,vegdeg,,,,,"A strategy I would use is after you have a conversation with them, follow up with an email summarizing the direction/next steps and deadlines.

Give the opportunity for them to add/note what they heard differently.

I often times do this especially in large meetings where the action plan/next steps are very easy to get lost and is just a good practice in general."
,,ventingin2020,,,,,"Thank you for this! I hate to be annoying and say ‚ÄúI already do this.‚Äù But, I already do this lol :-( I also recap and even send drafts of emails even if he just gave me the task an hour before to ensure I have in writing nothing has changed and he‚Äôs still aligned."

As well as all the other engineering which requires software knowledge and applied mathematics as well as physics and the actual type of engineering. That's a degree only thing and will also take you about 10 years if you have no formal math background past trigonometry. You won't hit anything aiming so broadly. Narrow your focus"

,,secondrat,,,,,"What about going to work for a company that makes plumbing products?  Sales?  Marketing?  You probably know the products better than the people working there. 

One piece of advice i can give is to think of your career as a three legged stool. You can balance on two legs while you fix one. But if you try to fix 2 or 3 you will crash to the ground. 

Try to change only one part of your career at a time. Stick with the plumbing field but look for a different role. Or specialize. Or start your own business and hire young kids to do the work. Not sure how?  Take a couple classes at your local community college then hang up a shingle."
,,,,,,,"Hey man, I am a Licensed Plumber as well, and I was able to get out of the field. If you want to get out of the industry, then that's fine, but there are plenty of great office based jobs that can use your mechanical experience in the construction industry.

I work as a Detailer, drawing/coordinating/designing layout of Plumbing and Piping systems. With BIM (Building Information Modeling) on the rise, there are a ton of jobs that are opening up to do this type of thing. The best part is, the companies hiring will take your Plumbing experience over a college degree

From what I have seen, the minimum for this type of role is around 50-60k and can get up around 6-figures (depending on job title, location, company, etc.).

Look into it, it could be an option. Just look up BIM on google and search for BIM designers, modelers, and detailers on job boards. There is a need for BIM people and many employers will train you on the software, as long as you have a desire to learn it. They do this because it is easier to teach BIM to a Tradesman, than to teach a trade to a CAD-school grad.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I forgot to say, that the way you describe yourself, it seems you would do well in this role. I can say I am also a perfectionist, who is good with numbers, and likes to learn. This can be said for nearly everyone in my office as well lol. The role requires an attention to detail and a desire to learn new things (as the technology is vast and always changes). So, think about it, as it could be an option."
,,dickprunetracey,,,,,"Hey OP - have you considered heading into Project Management (Construction)? That is - overseeing the build of a project? (school / hospital / residential / office) Project Management is inherently a generalist job - and indeed - requires all the skills that you mentioned above - especially doing with people. 

Your plumbing background would be worth its weight in gold especially when overseeing the build, and dealing with people on-site and off-site. Depending on how high you want to move up in the ranks, it can be quite pressuring (especially you are the lead PM) - but with that pressure comes more money.

,,,,,,,"I felt the same way when a Journeyman told me about this position. I knew that I wanted to work this type of job, but didn‚Äôt know where to start. Now that I am here, I absolutely love my job. 

I will tell you what I tell other tradesman who are interested:

1. Learn about the technology. If you are a student anywhere, you can get Autodesk Software (AutoCAD, Revit, Navisworks) for free, as they have free student licenses. Do your research on various topics in this part of the industry. I would start with learning more about BIM as this is gaining traction in the industry and the majority of contractors are using it now. Also, look up stuff like Project Delivery Methods, LOD, And drafting basics. Revit is the industry standard BIM software, but many companies still use AutoCAD. (Revit take a lot of computing power, so if you dont have a computer with good enough specs, you can learn basics of CAD and drafting using AutoCAD).

2. Be great in your current job role and learn what you can in the field while you search for design jobs. Take a look at the prints in the field (if you work in new construction) and be the best Plumber you can be. Also, think about how all the trades interact with one another and try to get a better understanding of a construction project as a whole.

3. Network with others in the industry, namely ones that are working in job roles you want to be in. Get a LinkedIn and start following people, especially recruiters. There are multiple Recruiting agencies that specialize in BIM/VDC employment opportunities, so you could start there. Tell people who you talk to about your professional goals and ambitions. You may just get an opportunity through someone, who knows someone, who is hiring. Thats how I got my current job.

All in all, you will never know everything there is to know about BIM/VDC, but the main thing is that you have an interest to learn. Employers will see that and once you get your first opportunity, then you can gain experience. So, don‚Äôt be discouraged if you don‚Äôt get a job offer right away, keep learning, keep networking, and keep applying to positions. Even if something says 1-2 years of experience, apply anyways because they very well might give you a shot. Just don‚Äôt lie on your resume.

Good luck man, feel free to dm me if you have more questions."
,,Imjustheredudez,,,,,"In my free time I do the following: playing music on my guitar or piano (not as often as I used to) I recently took up piano classes to try and learn theory but it‚Äôs pricey

,,BrooklynBillyGoat,,,,,"Alright I was in this position priorly. Stop searching careers and just go try random shit. Try writing a story or movie u wanna film, go try coding or graphic design, download some music software, you won't be able to decide without basis.

I read a lot of other things about neuroscience and psychology and whatnot but more when I was younger now to a lesser extent"

,,MonsterMaestro,,,,,"This is some ""just-starting-out"" career stuff that is pretty common in this thread.

1. Nobody can decide what is ""right"" for you but you. Most of the dilemma you described was about personal preference. Either solution can be optimal.

2. For a practical tip, it seems like your could probably use the feelings expressed in this post to optimize your job hunting. While you may not have specific criteria for the kind of job you want, it does seem like you have specific requirements around culture."
,,Nervous_Magazine_200,,,,,"Maybe give it a shot in a low level office job first. I used to feel the same way you do about preferred work hours and I found that I prefer working those hours. I have every evening, weekend and holiday to myself. And the pay is fantastic. I was a server before myself. It was fun, but so stressful and clocking in and out every shift sucks. In my job, I don't care if my assistant is ten minutes late. She does her job very well. And no one cares if I'm a half hour late. I'm salaried and as long as I hit my sales goals, stuff like leaving early for an appointment or taking a long lunch with a clue are no problem. I come into the office knowing what I have to do that day. No one's watching our every move or micromanaging us. (If there were complaints or I wasn't hitting my goals, it'd be a different story, of course.) I say give it a shot."

Also college is a rung in a very long ladder of your career, discovering your ""calling"" isn't exactly (I think) a particularly fulfilling career path.

Should I negotiate a 1k higher salary before accepting a job offer?,143r4ml,Revolutionary_Bat907,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/143r4ml/should_i_negotiate_a_1k_higher_salary_before/,3,61,1686176853.0,
,,pure_coconut_water,,,,,"Just say, ‚Äúmake it 48 and I‚Äôll sign today.‚Äù And then be ready to sign asap."
,,EnvironmentalOkra529,,,,,"Request $50k. They will come back with a counter offer which will likely be at least $48k. It is not going to hurt to negotiate, they aren't going to withdraw their offer based on you negotiating. The worst that can happen is they say no and continue to offer $47k."
,,TheDistrict15,,,,,"I‚Äôm really excited about this opportunity I‚Äôm looking forward to joining xyz company. During our first conversation I gave a range but after learning more about the role and seeing that my experience seems to line up well I‚Äôd be most comfortable if we could start me out at $50k if you think that‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm ready to commit right now. 

This should be done over the phone not via email"
,,Job-strategist-CPRW,,,,,"You still have time to negotiate before you sign the offer letter. Always ask for a little more than the original offer and then go from there. They will likely return and offer you a little less than you requested.

When you have the opportunity to negotiate you should take it. Knowing that your friend started at a higher salary before you should give you confidence that the company can afford that much at least. Ask away.

Tell them you are excited to join and will sign the same day if the salary you ask for is met.

Here's an example script of what you can say ""Thank you so much for your offer. I would love to be part of your team. Can we discuss a bit more about the salary package? It is a bit lower than what I would be comfortable with compared to my level of experience in the field. I am confident that I will be able to bring a lot more value to your business just as I surpassed all industry benchmarks and grow the department just as I have for my previous employer."" 

You can check out a few examples in this article below that helped me negotiate my salary.

[How to Negotiate A Salary](https://www.findmyprofession.com/career-advice/how-to-negotiate-salary/)

You got this!"
,,D0c10r_Wh0,,,,,"If you need a job, ask and be prepared to tKe the offer, if your getting more now you can ask but you need ti weight in, travel, insurance, and growth as part of the offers. I have taken reduced salary for learing and insurance options over cash time and again."
,,rwisdom64,,,,,"It's only $83.33 more per month, so just over $40 per pay period before taxes - seems hardly worth it, their offer is $10k more than you already make.  You should have been more specific, they met your pay request and it may turn them off to renegotiate now."
,,Used-Instruction-575,,,,,1k is really not worth asking for imo. It's just annoying to the hiring manager. Should have been clear in your range and said 48-50 if 48 was as low as you would go.
,,hownot2getajob,,,,,"If a candidate asked for 1,000 more it would be a 100% no go and we would all laugh in the background. Ask for 50K. $250 more a month is barely worth asking for after taxes but it‚Äôs a nice round number and will help increase future raises. Also for future never give a range if you‚Äôre not truly willing to accept the range. You want 50k not 45-50k they delivered exactly what you asked for."
,,JSutt771,,,,,"$1k is petty.  That is, ballpark, .50 an hour.  It's a difference of $20 on your 40 hr check.

I mean, you can ask for it, but it's a pretty small hill to die on."
,,Lord_Kaplooie,,,,,Always.
,,Snowconetypebanana,,,,,"I never give a range when they  ask. I ask them what the budget is for the position and tell them how much I‚Äôd expect in compensation would be based on what the job entailed. If I wanted 48k I‚Äôd ask for 50k. You shave off a year worth of raises by getting that 1k extra. I always ask for more and I‚Äôve never had anybody rescind an offer, majority of the time I got something. The one time that they said I was at the max of the budget for the position, they said they‚Äôd give me a bonus, and agreed to a raise after 90 days based on productivity."
,,LeadingTheme4931,,,,,Always ask for 5-8-10% higher than you expect. But it only if you haven‚Äôt already had this convo w/ then before.
,,jjflight,,,,,"If you‚Äôre going to negotiate, you need to be comfortable with the risk that you can lose the offer entirely.  These subs are filled with folks who negotiated because they were told they should always ask for more and then lost their offer. If 47k is acceptable to you (which it probably should be since it‚Äôs in the range you gave them), just take it if you‚Äôre not willing to gamble your offer away."
,,gmr548,,,,,"Question - what‚Äôs a typical employee benefit package consist of in the UK? In the US we‚Äôre talking retirement contributions, health/dental insurance, paid holiday, etc. I know the health care thing obviously wouldn‚Äôt apply but if the rest of a typical package is is similarly comprehensive I‚Äôd just say their benefits fall a little short of your current job and ask for 50k - high end of your range - to make up for that. You did already give a range so I probably wouldn‚Äôt be trying to push it beyond that number.

Asking for 1k more is just dumb."
,,VrinTheTerrible,,,,,"$1k a year / 52 weeks = $19 / week.

,,Ordinary-Win-4065,,,,,Lol you lost already. Why didn't you ask what their expected range of pay was? They could have been paying 60k+. You done blew over 10k if it is the case.
,,,,,,,Lol 1k higher is a few bucks extra a pay check
,,Additional-Local8721,,,,,"For all of you saying, don't risk it, it's only $1K; it's not worth it. You're thinking wrong. Always push for a little more. People, including hiring managers, always want to take the path of least resistance, which means they rather say Yes than No. The hiring manager already has it in their mind that you're working there and planning stuff. A small $1K difference shouldn't scare them off. As the employee, you hold the leverage.

Also, it's not just $1K. It's $1K compounded at an average of 3% annual raise for your entire career. If you have at least another 30 working years, that's $100K you'd be missing out on. The worst thing they can say is no, and you still accept the offer. Don't be afraid to be your own advocate."
,,swissarmychainsaw,,,,,"1,000 / 12 = $83.5 /2 = $41.6 per paycheck.  
Nope.  
They gave you what you asked for, I don't think its enough to cause a fuss over."
,,OrganicFrost,,,,,"No harm in saying ""Thank you for the offer!  I'm really excited about this position.  Would you be able to go up to 50k?  If so, I'd be thrilled to accept immediately.""

This doesn't close the door on accepting 47, just offers them an instant yes if they can go to 50."
,,Franklin135,,,,,1k is peanuts.  Don't piss them off over peanuts.
,,kaiwrx,,,,," It's kind of silly to ask for 1K Just because it's such a small difference. Ask if there is anything that you could do to get closer to 50k and see if they settle in between? The difference is so small, If it were like a 15k range for the position based on experience, I would feel fine asking for 5k more and seeing if they settled, I don't know why 1k just feels odd"
,,No-Explanation-2652,,,,,Do it.
,,,,,,,Eh‚Ä¶ 1k not much different. I say take it and get a raise later. General rule of thumb though you should always be asking for more than you actually expect to get so they can negotiate you down to what you wanted.
,,justaguyonthebus,,,,,"This is my favorite response to an offer:

> If you can get that up about 10%, it makes it an easy yes and I would sign right now."
,,AussieDesertNomad,,,,,Ask for $50k or nothing extra at all. No offence but I‚Äôd laugh out loud if someone requested an extra $1k. Screams amateur and that they can just push back and say no and you‚Äôll accept it
,,soulshine_walker3498,,,,,"Asking for more wouldn‚Äôt hurt your relationship, i think they partially expect it. And you have every right to ask, because the worst they can do is say no. And are you sure they won‚Äôt work in the pension to highest amount you end up making? That‚Äôs how it is where I work"
,,moediggity3,,,,,"It may depend on factors we don‚Äôt have answers to. Is this a small company where every dollar comes out of the boss‚Äô pocket? Or is this a large company where you‚Äôre filling an important role that is supported by revenue generated elsewhere?

I just started a great job at a company I‚Äôve worked for before. They made an offer that was $10k more than I was making. I really wanted the job, but I pushed for an extra $10k anyway and I got it. The last time my boss had to think about my salary was when she agreed to pay it, but it‚Äôs a multi billion dollar company and my salary is an insignificant piece of a line item in the scope, which is why I suspected I could get it. It isn‚Äôt as if my boss wakes up every morning revisiting that conversation or wonders if I‚Äôll ever earn the difference between what was offered initially and where we actually settled. 

If you‚Äôre the right candidate for the job, they likely will not pull the offer over negotiations. They may say no, but they may say yes. I wouldn‚Äôt think it would tarnish the relationship, hey, we‚Äôre all in it for the money at the end of the day. 

I had a former boss tell me you should always negotiate salary. Whether you get what you want or not, you‚Äôll have a better idea of who you‚Äôre dealing with."
,,thegreatbobo1,,,,,"Ask for $5k more.  The worst they can say is, ‚Äúsorry, but we only budgeted for this amount for this year, but let‚Äôs discuss again when it‚Äôs time for raise.  But we still hope you will join us.‚Äù  Think about from the company‚Äùs perspective.  It‚Äôs such a small amount that they are more concerned about pissing you off more than you should be about pissing them off.

This board seems like they‚Äôre split 50/50.  I guarantee you that the people advising you to negotiate are making significantly more than the people who are telling you to just accept the offer and the reason is because that‚Äôs what each group has been doing for their own situation.  It‚Äôs just like asking a girl out on a date.  Once you start doing it, you realize that in most cases, the worst thing that can happen is that she says no.  And, in most cases, guys that don‚Äôt have a problem asking end up with the prettiest girls."
,,HansGigolo,,,,,"You're mistake was giving them a range, they offered the middle of your range, what did you expect?  Should have just said 50k and you likely would have gotten it.  Personally I think you look petty asking for a 1k increase and probably shouldn't do it."
,,Peace_Love_Curl,,,,,"Companies always start with their lowest offer and have room to negotiate. Do not come back at the amount you want. I always do at least 10% higher. Since you have them a range. I would flat out ask for 50k. State your qualities (over the phone) and look up the average in Glassdoor to make sure it is aligned with your area. If it‚Äôs over 50k, say after research I have learned someone with my experience earns XX. I think XX would be a reasonable counter. If they say no, ask about sign on bonuses if it‚Äôs a high demand position. They can only say no and you are in the same position. Good luck!!

Also: Do not give a salary range. You do not know what companies are willing to offer for positions. Giving a range can make you lowball yourself. I think you already have because they offered you something in the middle of your range and not your bottom number. Next time say my salary is negotiable and I am willing to entertain all offers at this time. Just in case they come in higher. And look companies up on Glassdoor. The ranges, in my opinion, have been close to what I have made at various companies."
,,T-yler--,,,,,"In your case, a week's vacation is worth $1000. Maybe ask for an extra week off paid leave... its totally up to you."
,,hempernest,,,,,"Work 6 months there, show your value and ask for 5-10K more, dont haggle for such a low amount.  
when you want to ask for a real rise you dont want to be remembered as the one who already was asking for raises since the first day but as the one who is doing a good job and deserves more."
,,Spirited-Caregiver19,,,,,Where do you work that has a pension
,,Sevwin,,,,,I‚Äôd ask for 50K.
,,Expert_Equivalent100,,,,,"This. If that‚Äôs your negotiation point, make sure it‚Äôs the one you want. If they give it to you and then you try to add more money or some other benefit after is when you would land yourself on their bad side. But any decent company isn‚Äôt going to have an issue with you negotiating a little. I build room for that into all my offers I make."
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"Thank you. I know this is logical and it‚Äôs what I would say to friends myself, but I‚Äôve never had a job offer like this before and suddenly I‚Äôm overthinking it!"
,,hownot2getajob,,,,,This is the way
,,Additional-Local8721,,,,,Thus is the wrong way to think about it. It's only 1K now. But compound that with an average 3% annual raise over 30 years and you missed out on an additional 100K you could've made.
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"Thanks for your response. 
That‚Äôs fair, I do accept that. At that point my friend hadn‚Äôt told me his starting salary but he‚Äôs since opened up and made me wonder about the extra 1k and if it‚Äôs worth pursuing. 

At the company I‚Äôm currently at, 1k is a *massive* pay rise so it feels like a lot to me! However, not at the expense of tarnishing the relationship, of course, which is why outsiders‚Äô perspectives are so useful."
,,thegreatbobo1,,,,,"Exactly.  It‚Äôs nothing.  So ask for it and the worst thing the company can say is no.  It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhill to die on‚Äù.  In fact, he should ask for $5k more."
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,Thanks for your response! Do you have any suggestions on how you might approach the situation?
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,Thanks for sharing your experience. Glad to hear you‚Äôve got a strategy that works for you. Definitely noting this down for the future!
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"Thanks for your response, always appreciate a bit of caution! 

Context: they had not been seeking candidates, but I was looking for a job and decided to send my CV in anyway. They were curious enough to invite me to interview and then said they‚Äôd ‚Äútry to open a position‚Äù for me because the interview went very well. 

I hope (!) that gives me more leverage since I‚Äôm not actively competing against others for the role?  Or, in your experience, could negotiating on such amounts leave a ‚Äòbad taste‚Äô that could result in a rescinded offer?"
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"Thanks for responding! That is a good question, and worth considering in the whole ‚Äúdo I, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù of my post. 

There seems to be quite a range in benefits here, depending on the industry. The perks you mentioned are generally covered by workplaces at a basic level, but it is very unusual for my sector to go above the legal minimum. The total job offer from this company includes enhanced benefits, for the very first time in my life. 

My friend has maintained that, since he received 48k, there‚Äôs no reason I shouldn‚Äôt be able to. I‚Äôm not sure whether he had negotiated his offer though‚Ä¶ which puts me in a completely different situation!"
,,EnvironmentalOkra529,,,,,"I was the same!! I was offered $48k, asked for $50, got $49. I was super worried because it was just after the recession, I had been looking for years, and I was kind of desperate! But it turned out it was no big deal, they said yes right away. That was 9 years ago and nowadays companies are more desperate to hire (in the US anyway). You should have even better luck!"
,,AntiHyperbolic,,,,,"You‚Äôve probably already done what you‚Äôre going to do, but 3k for almost any company is nothing, and it‚Äôs big in your life time earnings.  Ask for 50 and say you‚Äôll sign immediately."
,,Best-Turnover-6713,,,,,"It's also the wrong way to think about it because it's ""only"" 83.33 a month to them.  They already committed to 47K.  83.33 a month is a department's daily coffee supply.  They want the guy and will likely pay to the max of the range to avoid recruitment costs."
,,soulshine_walker3498,,,,,This
,,Used-Instruction-575,,,,,Congratulations on your new opportunity. Either way you go I'm sure you'll be fine.
,,JSutt771,,,,,"Actually, the worst thing the company can say is ""the offer is rescinded"", which has happened to people before.

I agree, if he's going to ask for anything he should be asking for $5k more, but just asking for $1k is petty and unnecessary."
,,Lord_Kaplooie,,,,,"From personal experience, I always ask for a little bit more after their offer, and I've always gotten it. I mean, they like you enough to extend an offer. They're excited that you'll be joining them. The HM isn't going to rescind it for an extra $1000. And if they do, they're showing you what it's going to be like come raise/bonus time.

Couple pointers for the next time:

1. **Always** negotiate your starting salary. Your friend is correct; raises and bonuses will always be anchored on what you're currently making.
2. Phrase the request in a positive light. ""This offer looks great. I'm excited to sign on, but I'd be really happy if you came up another $1k.""
3. Make the reasons about yourself, not someone else. ""I can add value because..."" rather than ""My buddy in the same position made this much.""
   1. Related, only give one reason and stick to it.
4. When you give a range, don't round to the closest $5k. Ask for $63k to $72k. It's a subtle way to show you know the market, and aren't just picking numbers out of the air."
,,gmr548,,,,,This is important context. They‚Äôre literally creating a job for you out of thin air. They obviously want you.
,,jjflight,,,,,"One path: you absolutely blew them away, so you have some leverage.  Another path: someone said ‚Äúhey, I like their persistence, let‚Äôs take a chance on this person,‚Äù and you do not have alot of leverage since they think they‚Äôre doing you a favor.  I don‚Äôt know enough to tell which it is.  But if there wasn‚Äôt a role open before you reached out that may say the business need likely wasn‚Äôt extreme (otherwise they‚Äôd be actively recruiting for it).

Yes, I have both seen firsthand and read many many posts here about folks losing offers when employers got a bad taste.  Put yourself in their shoes: a candidate asked for something, they said yes and gave them what they wanted, and now the candidate is saying they want more‚Ä¶ could that put a bad taste in your mouth?  In this case it‚Äôs less the negotiating and more that it may feel in bad faith since they already met your ask."
,,gmr548,,,,,"I mean at a basic level your friend is obviously right and I agree, unfortunately there‚Äôs this whole charade attached to it.

To your other comment, given they seem to really want you I‚Äôd still make the $50k ask. They shouldn‚Äôt have a significant negative reaction to a number a few thousand pounds higher and within your stated range. If they say no they say no. Maybe they come back and say $48k is best and final.

But ultimately if you‚Äôre happy with the $47k and don‚Äôt feel like risking that, that‚Äôs understandable."
,,Used-Instruction-575,,,,,"Also, to be clear, I think 1k is not worth asking for if you're going to ask for more. Ask for 50 or 55. Nice, even numbers."
,,thegreatbobo1,,,,,"What kind of jobs/companies are you talking about that an employer has rescinded an offer to a candidate for negotiating rather than simply saying they can‚Äôt give more?  Is this something you‚Äôve actually seen or just speaking hypothetically?  If we‚Äôre speaking hypothetically, the worst is that they also hire a pin assassin and slit your throat in your sleep.  I am a corporate lawyer and I have never seen in my 20 years of practice someone getting an offer pulled because they tried to negotiate salary and it is frankly unthinkable that a company would do that."
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"In a way, yes! But does that change your opinion (given your other comment and my response to it)?"
,,Revolutionary_Bat907,,,,,"Thank you, and thanks for your wishes too. :-)

This is definitely a ‚Äònote to self‚Äô to be more careful about ranges in the future! It may have been better to suggest a higher figure, expecting them to negotiate down. Seems very obvious now‚Ä¶ we live and learn!"
,,JSutt771,,,,,"I've seen it twice in IT.  The first time, the guy kept negotiating and the company made an offer to a rival candidate, who accepted.  They subsequently rescinded the offer to the first guy.

The second time, the hiring manager just got his panties in a bunch because he felt it was offensive and unprofessional to not just accept whatever the company offered and he pulled the offer.

Mind you, I'm not arguing right or wrong, moral or immoral, legal or illegal.  Just pointing out that it can, and does, happen.  As a lawyer, I'm surprised that just because something hasn't happened to you that's enough to make you think it doesn't happen."
,,thegreatbobo1,,,,,"So, first example is not applicable because asking once is very different from extensive negotiation.  Second example seems to be a one-off and I‚Äôd suggest that an employer that refuses to engage with you in an earnest salary negotiation (whether at the time of hire or subsequently) is a huge red flag.  If anything, asking for a higher salary should be part of the ‚Äúinterview your employer‚Äù process.  

I didn‚Äôt say that it never happens.  I said it‚Äôs unthinkable that a company would do that because it‚Äôs so ridiculous to lose a candidate you liked and risk your reputation like that over a couple of thousand dollars.  Yes, a bridge might collapse while you cross it (and it has happened), but it doesn‚Äôt mean you should avoid all bridges.  For each example, I can give you a hundred examples where someone negotiated their salary and didn‚Äôt get the offer rescinded.  It‚Äôs a simple risk-benefit analysis and it‚Äôs overwhelmingly positive to try to negotiate your salary, especially at the time of hire when the candidate has the maximum leverage."

day is necessarily something I can do for the next 40 years


I hear this all the time. I hate it. I've seen multiple friends and family self-immolate and have a crappy career and struggle because ""I don't want to be at computer."" And then everyone is jealous of me because I took a cue from my father and chose a career and stuck with it instead of bouncing off it because I have overly-high expectations for work.

What well paying jobs do you think are out there that you will not have to be inside and do some amount of computer work?

You don't know what to do because jobs that ""work with your hands"" don't pay nearly as much. Because you are LABOR, not a force multiplier for making a corporation money[0]. You don't know what to do because there is no magical job out there that has all of the properties you have arbitrarily set for yourself.

I would also like to make 150k/yr as a musician & composer. It's not gonna happen.

Do you know what it is like out there for people with low-status and low-education jobs? They treat you like trash and you get paid nothing. Or they tear your body apart so you can't have athletic hobbies into you 30s.

You are still pretty young, you have not gotten to the part of your life where the money you are making now pays off [1] and makes it feel worth it.

Take some vacations, have a nice dinner. Start going to the gym. Get some hobbies like guitar or golf or something. Get outside and actually use your time outside of work productively and maybe you will feel better.

0: Example: as a programmer I can write a feature that will save my company a million dollars a year, or make a million dollars a year. You cannot do this in many other careers. You make your company X - what they pay you. This will never add up to a million bucks.

1: buying a house, providing for a family, etc."

Find a good reputable factory, work your ass off for s good few years, bid on every promotion.

I went from temp to full time to Quality Engineering Technician to Supervisor in 3 years."
,,zacggs,,,,,"I have an associates of arts in Psychology from University of Phoenix Online. I usually don't lead with that, because I've been a professional manufacturing process engineer [Titular] since 2014. Because I don't have a degree(BA) my cap as an engineering technician is much lower than a fresh engineer grad. Thus I only had access to higher wages if I took on overtime, and with a family it is hard. I happen to be really good at what I do, and have found an excellent group of mentors and peers along the way coaching me to different project positions, essentially creating production lines with high industrial standards. 



That was until last month when my brother in law expanded his company, and I jumped back down to the bottom of a totem pole for experience, and apprenticeship. 


I went from organizing flow and designing layouts of 2000sqft production clean rooms to sweeping, moping and general manager duties of a 3000sq ft tattoo supply and studio. My BIL is a fully booked outstanding artist who had a life changing accident and started tattooing 8 years ago. His principals are that your work should compound in quality, every piece better than the last and everyone has a specialty preference to offer. 



This position where I am apprenticing under BIL, has uncapped income potential and is the most logical thing to remove my family from poverty. 



Nepotistic opportunities do not normally present themselves in such a fashion, and I certainly carry my weight with GM duties pulling experience from manufacturing that no tattoo artist would normally have.




Business [property] ownership is how you make good money, working for someone else's business is how you survive. 




Starting something is not easy, but need I remind you you're already in the business of motherhood, and that experience of multitasking is certainly transferrable!

,,Iswallowbigpickles,,,,,Learn a union trade and get paid while learning.
,,Automatic_Relation80,,,,,"I have an it degree I went back to school at 23 and am 26 with a Bachelors of Science, at an ok state school. 

Other than making some cool friends and being introduced to new things, I kinda regret it. I have 20k of debt. I went in thinking similar to how you sound. I wanted a better job, more respect and pay. That's why I chose IT. I went in for the wrong reasons and I'm more broke now!!! I almost think I'd have been better off getting into IT without a degree!! 

There are tons of certificates that teach more practical skills and companies that will hire for those credentials and no degree. If you can prove you know how to do what your applying for there could be great options.

A degree helps the job process but isn't required and totally does not determine your worth.

If you have something you really want to accomplish or learn and the step to getting there has to be college (e.g., nurse, engineer, doctor) Then school is a necessary part of the process. 

However there are plenty of ways to learn on line and create a portfolio to showcase your skills for other positions (e.g., photography, ux design, graphic design, developer jobs) 

There's also great certificates at community colleges which are cheaper and can be great for if you uncertain about what you want to do but want a formal education. Then you could start applying to jobs after the fert, find out if it's for you, and decide if higher education is right. For example: medical coding, administrative certificates, CRNA, emt, Phlebotomy, Surgical Tech, Radiological Tech)

If you can find a more inexpensive lower commitment/ lower risk way to get professional experience in anything that actually INTERESTS you or you could at least see yourself doing. Then I'd say do that

Professional experience is really helpful in getting a job some may say even more than college."

,,smurfvillage7,,,,,"I think the solution is always to get more job offers. Maybe the new mgt makes it a sinking ship. And the anxiety -- you have WAY less anxiety when other employers are offering you jobs. It's good you're looking for other jobs in the meantime, but are you doing it with some intensity?  Set a goal, like 5 job offers in the next one month. Do it like a game! Is that realistic right now for you?"
,,house9,,,,,"Like others have already said:

\- start looking for a new job

\- start working normal hours

I would also recommend using some kind of ticketing system or even a spreadsheet to track the incoming work. Try to meet with your boss once a week or day and prioritize that list, work from the top down on the most important tasks. If people start asking why some tasks are not being completed its because you are working on the most importing things first."
,,Fun_Apartment631,,,,,Set your working hours and stick to them.  Can you turn off work messaging?
,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"It's a good idea to prioritize self-care and stress-management techniques. This could include regular exercise, meditation, therapy, or hobbies that help you relax and recharge. Make sure to set boundaries around your work hours and stick to them as much as possible, even if it means saying no to some requests.  
  
While you're looking for other job opportunities, try to stay focused on your goals and remain optimistic. Consider reaching out to your network or connecting with others in your field to learn about potential opportunities. It's important to remember that this is a temporary situation and that you have the power to make positive changes for yourself.

No, srsly, don't even worry about it.

Do however stick to your current as long as you can, if ever gets too much or you start to get the sense that you may get fired, start looking for another one - it is much easier to find another job when you already have one (such a bad irony, I know)

,,Agreeable-Memory3392,,,,,"If you find yourself in a situation where you feel underqualified or overwhelmed, it's important to take proactive steps to address the situation. You can seek additional training or professional development opportunities to build your skills, ask for support or guidance from your colleagues or manager, and communicate any concerns or challenges you may have. It's also important to give yourself time to adjust to a new role and be patient with yourself as you learn and grow in your career.

Take advantage of any training or resources that your employer may offer, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance from your colleagues or managers.

From what I am reading - you are walking the same path and many others who are beginning their careers. If anything this is the most beneficial journey in the 21st because you can quickly discover what you do/do not like to do. 

As opposed to forcing yourself to stick to something for 25 years out of necessity and turning into a pessimistic nufty...

It sounds like you're qualified for your but may be being held back by imposter syndrome. I'd probably encourage that you see your current role as another opportunity to add another skillset to you quiver :)"
,,Sensitive_Counter150,,,,,"Just for you to have an idea, I work for a huge tech company and the official HR rule about job hopper for JR levels was to only bring this point in an interview if the person went through 4 different companies (companies, not Jobs, having multiple Jobs/teams inside the same company was not poorly seems at all) in the same year - but even that could be justified in the interview.
I hired something like 40 ppl last year, and I woulnd't question a thing in your CV.

,,iamnotbart,,,,,"I suggest getting your masters in education.. then your MBA. You will need to be a teacher at an existing school for a while, then work your way up to principal. You won't have any credibility starting your own school without having any experience. It's also a way for you to learn about the accreditation process, which you will need for your school to have any type of legitimately.

As far as funds? You will need a lot. You can work with the local governments on that, but expect tuition to be high.

This will be a lot harder than you think, and I don't think you understand the scope of doing something like this. You need to teach for a while to get a better idea.

I've done IT work in education for 20 years, and from the bits and pieces I know about running a school, it's not an easy task and you will have a high likelihood of failure."

,,jmc1278999999999,,,,,"Probably not, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a company that‚Äôll pay for insurance ahead of your start date unless you‚Äôre in a really specialized field or in a c-suite type of position."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"Generally, no. But you can ask."
,,thefuji,,,,,"If your current employer is big enough they may be required to offer COBRA continuation of coverage. They would need to have 20 or more full time equivalent employees during the prior year. This would allow you to continue your coverage until your new jobs health insurance kicks in. Keep in mind that you will now be paying 100% of the premiums (no employer contribution) plus an additional fee of 2% to choose this option. If your coverage would be dangerous to leave or if you have already met a significant portion of your deductible / out of pocket max then the 102% premium may be totally worth it. 

Your new employer may have classes with different waiting periods but the longest the wait can potentially be is 90 days, with coverage effective on the 91st day. So you would be on the hook for 3 months of cobra premiums."
,,Bereaver4,,,,,"OP you can negotiate it but it's unlikely that it'll be approved. What would more likely happen is you getting money or having gap insurance covered. Gap insurance is usually made for this, where you are in between jobs and want healthcare coverage. It's also much cheaper than cobra as well if we have to cover it out of pocket."
,,Creative_Angela,,,,,"Yes my current job has insurance but I want to switch jobs. The company aligns more with my future goals and pays double my salary.

,,em-bodiedcoaching,,,,,"Recognising others accomplishments can be hard to admit, I think it comes down to first owning our own achievements, talents and feeling rooted in ourselves.

It is good to normalise all those feelings though, jealousy, comparisonitis, feeling less than, regret at how it played out and wanting to have done more. These are all natural emotions that many experience at work and in their everyday lives. Well done for admitting that and sharing how it is. 

I feel when that has happened to me, it is good to reflect a little and learn from it, so owning the work you did do and the strengths and talents that you offer in your role. I am sure you did work hard, but also to accept on this occasion your colleague delivered in a way that matched what they were looking for. I wouldn't stew on it any more than that and focus now on showing up as best you can in your work. You don't need to contrive feeling happy for them, but use that fuel to recognise each one of us has different strengths and maybe that task suited them more or consider how you can show up to a project like this next time.

I also feel asking 2 people to work on the same task is direct competition, but maybe you were supposed to work on this together, I am not quite sure, but don't be too hard on yourself."
,,beansproutclout,,,,,"I've been in the corporate industry for a little more than 3 years so please take my advice with a grain of salt.

Many, if not, all, comments under this post is telling you to squash your feelings, but that's easier said than done. At the end of the day, work is work, and if these feelings bother you even when you're not at work, if you're crying on the phone with a friend in a target parking lot about the situation then do something about it. Voice your opinion to your manager (maybe not the presentation style, but the possibility of pitting you and your colleague against each other). If there aren't any changes and your manager continues to support this sort of culture, maybe this workspace isn't for you. Find a different group that you can work with. Your physical, mental, and emotional health shouldn't be at risk. That will also deteriorate all your hard work and your brand you've been trying to build up.

I'm speaking from my own experience where I've had projects taken from me and given to folks who were barely at the company for a year while my manager would be on maternity leave, and my lack of visibility was taken advantage of where lead roles would also be given to people with little to no experience whereas I've had a couple of years at this point. 

Like I said, it's definitely easier said than done, but don't forget the only advocate for yourself is you."

,,xch13fx,,,,,"As someone with no experience doing either of those two things, I would view going from Sr Manager to Executive Assistant as a big step back. Pay might be similar, but I think you'd find it difficult to go into anything other than being assistant going forward. No offense to any EA's out there, it's just not anything I'd personally choose for myself, and since you are asking for advice... my advice is to not do this."
,,jmc1278999999999,,,,,"I wouldn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre probably should expect a significant decrease in pay. I have a senior role (albeit not in marketing) and make almost triple what our EA‚Äôs are paid and we pay ours well above the average rate in our area."
,,dlm83,,,,,"I've gone backward and sideways a few times from a job level/income perspective because I thought there was more opportunity and growth to be had switching. I even switched roles at the same company from exactly a Senior Manager level position to a lower level before, so yep! About 6 years on from that decision I was earning almost 4x the income the Senior Manager role I left was paying, and that was without any focus on money, it just happened.

Just sent you a DM with the response I wrote out here but upon review decided is a little too personal/could identify me (which isn't the end of the world at all but kind of creeps me out!).  
But generally speaking, at age 30ish and working on an assumption that a professional career usually begins sometime around 22 and a retirement age of 60, you're only 1/5 of your way into your career. Plenty of time to go backward, sideward etc and get valuable experience if you see opportunities (and time to recover from any setbacks from a bad decision). 

There are a lot of variables but if someone has a high ceiling (like VP+), continuing in a role/focused on a particular discipline isn't necessarily the best path toward achieving full potential and it can actually slow you down. ""Going back to go forward"" could well be the best thing for you if you're thinking not about the most immediate job change but 3 or 4 jobs from now.... especially if there are some development roadblocks in your current role (could be as simple as a shitty leader and little focus on development)."

If it‚Äôs a move along those lines where you‚Äôll have less work and more or the same money, I‚Äôd recommend it. 30 is a great time to ride the coat tails of the hard work you did in your 20‚Äôs. I‚Äôm no longer interested in climbing the corporate ladder. I do a good job at my job and it doesn‚Äôt suck the energy out of me!"
,,mindtoxicity27,,,,,"From a career progression stand point, yeah it looks weird. However, you can pretty it up if you can convince them to give you a good title like ‚Äúchief of staff‚Äù or something.

But I would think going from senior manager to EA would potentially feel less fulfilling and it could be difficult to transition from decision maker to grunt work.

However, in my career I have seen tons of EAs move directly to deputy director roles and such. So it‚Äôs a mixed bag."
,,QuitaQuites,,,,,"Do you want to be an executive assistant? Are you prepared for what that entails? Depending on the company and personnel you could rise back up quickly title wise and EA‚Äôs depending on the specific industry and level can make well over six figures, but title wise sure it looks like a step back."
,,dlm83,,,,,"One advantage OP has is that it's an internal move, so they may be able to negotiate staying somewhere around current levels depending on the company and whether the decision makers see this as part of developing/retaining the OP beyond the EA role etc. They did mention money as a factor so presumably won't consider the switch if pay will be adjusted according to what we might expect of EA level comp and not according to an exception being made for them. Fingers crossed it's the latter if all other variables have lead them to favor the switch!"
,,dlm83,,,,,"The massive caveat to this, of course, is what you believe you'd get out of the lower level role. Not all EA positions are the same, but some can be more like a chief of staff or just broadly a 'right hand' to the business leader type experience. I've seen EAs tasked with the responsibility of leading and coordinating enterprise level strategic planning and annual planning (and the periodic progress reviews etc), in which they had to learn various methodologies and approaches to such and work almost exclusively with VP and C-Level leaders in the process. They can also pick up a lot of cool projects (developing PM skills in the process and getting exposure to business units they have never worked in). Just as an example."

I work in tech and I‚Äôm in a male dominated office, With over 1000 employee. Im still seeing new faces every day. Any ways, people will come to me for help with various pc related issues. If there is someone already sitting in my waiting area getting assistance (usually a man) and another person (man) will walk up needing help as well, and will automatically assume the person sitting in my wait area is in charge and start asking them for help. 
Completely ignoring me‚Ä¶. This  like is a weekly occurrence‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs like the equivalent of showing up to an appointment and asking the other person In the waiting room to check you in and totally ignoring the receptionist behind the desk lmao 

It‚Äôs kind of funny when the person they asked for help just points at me and says ask her haha"
,,Sitcom_kid,,,,,"You are being given advice based on lowered expectations. I know it's just more advice, but I think it would make a great book. But even if you don't want to be an author, I'm a little bit familiar with this because I'm a sign language interpreter and that connects somewhat to deaf education, and the students are always being told to go for the jobs where you destroy your entire body for terrible wages. The best advice is not to listen to that kind of advice."
,,Disney-Plus_baby,,,,,"To clarify , I am referring how ‚Äúadvice‚Äù -In regards to career and future opportunities- is projected differently in respect in between ethnicity/Race , youth ,and socio-economic demographics in the U.S.A..

In other words, my prospective is respectfully focusing on how a range of ethnicities in the U.S from Latinos/as ( Decent of Mexico, South/Central America,Brazil, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico etc ) to Hispanics to how White American youth are being presented vastly different advice from people their lives such as their family, peers, friends,coworkers, strangers etc.."
,,Disney-Plus_baby,,,,,"I also understand that socio economic income and other environmental factors may influence how people may or may not understand this.For an example If a Latino was raised into a wealthy household , healthy upbringing , and access to Education and Resources poor people would ever dream of.. They would have a completely different perspective on this topic as they would UNLIKELY find those challenges encountered by low income populations .

Unfortunately, the U.S statistics show there is a wide gap of wealth and education between African/Black/Hispanic/Latin Americans and White/Asian populations.

Hopefully this brings awareness to people of all backgrounds to not get discouraged by the underwhelming advice or the lack of there of guidance in youth .

I learned the hard way and hopefully this platform spread the awareness of this silence  of guidance"

,,Tiny_Growth_6187,,,,,"I think it is important to understand that writing goals in the workplace are a current trend.  Your boss is likely checking a box to make sure that you check your goals box.  You are right in thinking that the PDs you are required to do should be your personal goal.    If you write it in the form of a SMART (Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timely,  goal, it will look better than saying, ""I will complete my training your goals"", try writing it like this:  By (insert date), I will complete (insert number) Professional Development sessions as evidenced by completion certificates.

By August 15, 2023, I will complete 27 training videos as evidenced by the digital certification certificates.   

or

In order to further develop my engineering experience, I will complete 27 training videos as evidenced by certifications.

If you want to 'on up' the training, find an extra webinar or training session to attend and add that to your goal."
,,marstheruler,,,,,"Is there a leveling rubric or career progression framework? Something to figure out what skills you‚Äôre expected to have at each level (junior vs senior)? That can be a good place to start.

If not, use your personal career goals. What skills do you need to reach the next step in your career? Do you want to learn some technique or get a certification, even improve your presentation or communication skills."
,,Hypegrrl442,,,,,"I always go with something on sort of the soft skills side, that seems very achievable. I‚Äôm one of the furthest things from an engineer, but for me it would be something like, ‚Äúfind a mentor or senior coworker and schedule a session to discuss my professional progress vis a vis this specific project or skill‚Äù or, ‚Äúcontinue training on x, and present to you or the rest of team or outside department the results/progress within 6 mos or after H1‚Äù, or even something as simple as ‚Äúcomplete items 1-7 on the training list by date, and identify 1-2 additional areas where I would like more training/to explore further, etc‚Äù

SMART goals as mentioned in a previous comment are important because when they‚Äôre too vague it becomes easier to hedge on reviews/salary negotiation, etc, and your idea of success could look very different than your manager‚Äôs. I also try to give a range or underestimate what the deliverable will look like though, because life always ends up getting in the way, which is why something like 27 PD sessions or completing all training tasks in 6 months may feel achievable now, but ultimately isn‚Äôt possible"

,,RatRaceAI,,,,,"Any interest in product management? If you find the right org it could be a very balanced mix of customer-facing, stakeholder-facing and dev-facing work.... Probably one of the most social roles in tech.  


For digital marketing, a masters really wouldn't be necessary; most schools won't teach you the practical, modern tools needed to get hired. It'll be conceptual fluff and then you'll have to learn the tools on your own anyways.... But you can learn all you need to know online for \~free (Hubspot, Google, Facebook) with maybe a short paid bootcamp to get a brand name later, as long as you build a decent portfolio. Lots of companies offering internships or resume booster projects if you explore the right circles enough. Though, not sure it will get you as ""engaged with people"" as you'd like, as most digital marketing work is still solo computer work. (I know someone close who transitioned to a paid digital marketing role in 4 months from a completely unrelated field, with the above method).

,,Foodie1989,,,,,"It's hard as a new graduate, I remember when I had trouble for a year. I work in HR so heres my tips when I recruited and also job searched:

1. You get your best chances at an interview when a job has been posted recently typically, I say about a week or two. When I recruited, there were just toooo many to go through so usually we search the first rush of resumes that come in.

2. Make your job match their posting with key words that you have experience in. A lot of selections are based off who matches what their job duties are. Some bots even go by certain key words.

3. Avoid fluff words like 'great team player', 'independent', etc. Instead try to bullet point what you've done and your accomplishments related to what they are looking for.

Since you are a recent graduate with limited experience, it sounds like you can be underqualified for those. Maybe start at a entry level even if it means for a year or so before applying for another. I took a crap HR internship for 2 months which finally helped me land my first HR job when I was job searching. Experience is everything.

Ok, so with interviews...I would say arrive on time if not a few minutes early, be personable, practice your interview beforehand with someone by searching most common interview questions (don't rehearse). I think it's a vibe between the two. A lot of people can have the skills but not everyone can work well and fit in with the team. In my experience, when I had sooo many job interviews..looking back the job offers I got were the ones I really liked and we vibex well. The others were just eh. So it takes time, eventually you'll find your fit. Goodluck!"
,,JSutt771,,,,,"I don't know much about business analysis or data analysis, but project management might be a bit much to aspire to right out of school.  Definitely keep tailoring your CV to the jobs you're applying to, though.

>my siblings keep saying if i wanted a job i would‚Äôve got it by now

I absolutely despise this.  People like to throw this out there like getting a job is a simple math equation and if you do certain things then poof!  You have a job.  Every company does things a little differently and what will work at one company will get you laughed out the door at another.

From what you've told us, it sounds like you're just aiming too high too soon.  Project management isn't the simplest thing in the world.  Most companies want to see that you've successfully worked on projects as part of a team before they actually put you in charge of one."
,,Dfiggsmeister,,,,,"It‚Äôs tough out there. You‚Äôre dealing with both recent graduates, career changers, and those who have been laid off. It‚Äôs been a tough field since 2004 and it just got progressively worse as the job requirements got more ridiculous. 

Keep applying but make sure you have key words that aligns to the job description because chances are they‚Äôre going to use an algorithm and keyword search on your application. That‚Äôs the initial screen. Then there will likely be a second screen with the recruiter to see if your experiences lines up with what they‚Äôre looking for. 

As for interviews, study up on the star method. Star stands for situation, tactics, actions, results. They‚Äôre looking for your approach of a situation and what the results were. Chances are you‚Äôve experienced something like it in your life somewhere."
,,Acceptable-Eye-5041,,,,,"thank you so much for the tips ! yeah  i think my experience is holding me back but i‚Äôve still had no luck with entry level roles, internships and even roles which literally need no experience like data entry ones ! but just think i think i need to improve on my cv and how i apply sun have taken your all your tips into account"

 Take some time out when you have time  and soul search and be deeply honest w yourself. Take the classes  that you can on the scholarship that can transfer to other degree programs. Forgive me, I'm tired, but like the general classes, that aren't
 necessarily law classes.

,,DumbDogma,,,,,"There's also the possibility of having one address that one spends 181 days a year at, and receives mail at, where one could legally reside. Since that's the legal residence, it may not matter where one physically is, so long as one is ""principally employed"" at a location in a given state.

I looked this up when I was living in Tennessee (no state income tax) and working in Georgia (which has a state income tax) for a company based in Tennessee, then placed on temporary assignment in the Tennessee office, reporting there daily for over a month. I was not able to avoid paying Georgia income tax, because my ""principal place of employment"" was in Georgia. If it had been the other way around, being principally assigned to work in the Tennessee office but temporarily working out of the Georgia office, I would not have had to pay Georgia income taxes for the month or so I that I was working there.

It's my understanding, though, that this varies wildly from state to state and even in some cases from city to city (I'm looking at you, New York City).

,,PhilWham,,,,,"Depends on what your career field is, what your interests are etc.

If you're going into high finance, sure the opps are there. If you are going into business ops then you could get that exp elsewhere. 

If you like city life, things like theater, food, etc then that can make it more worth it. But it all depends on preference. 

The same question could be asked on the opposite end of the spectrum: Is it worth living cheap in rural AZ or UT for young professionals? The answer is it depends greatly by person."

Look and see if your university or community college has positions for students. They tend to be on a good schedule, pay decent and at times there is downtime to study or homework. Speak with your area of focus‚Äô professors, they may know the connection of jobs open or where to look. (Your schools clubs or Greek Chapters are a good way too, and it looks good on your resume if you decide not to work). 

Next, I‚Äôd checked LinkedIn. You can find internships where it can be part time or full. They are a good way to gain experience during school. Most are geared towards Juniors and Seniors. Still, you can find them during your Freshman and Sophomore years. 

The last place I‚Äôd look is Indeed or Glassdoor (I prefer Glassdoor, seems of slightly hire quality)."

,,Leather-Wheel1115,,,,,"This is what I learnt. I have lot of access to employee wages at my job. What I have seen is there are managers who just gives away raises and they are good talkers where on other hand there are managers who are penny pinchers. My company is a small company 100 employee so departments do not have any budgets etc. I have one department who gets $4-6 raises while other department who has lease turn around and long term employees who get $2-3 raises. Performance wise the other department who never got raise does good job. This manager who never gave any raises got all the raise in his pocket. Just was a ass and never valued his team .

You would be surprise that best time to ask a raise is when company is doing bad as they need people to hang around for what ever projects they have. In bad times they already let go bad apples so if you are on a project, ask and you will get few bucks‚Ä¶

In my tenure I learnt, job is not a charity work, it‚Äôs business. You are not married to the company that you have to compromise.

Think it this way: in bad times Ceo ask you to compromise, take pay cut and work for free ( it‚Äôs like you donate to company your time and efforts for no pay). Now at the same time go and ask your HR that you had a family situation, can you loan me a $1000 with out work, the answer will NO. Our business does not allow and we do not do charity. You can die of hunger but company won‚Äôt loan you money. So why would you care for a company. This is extreme example but just trying to put a point across."

The convo went well and we are creating a new position for me!

Point is, you should never ignore your gut when it comes to these things. Make the switch earlier than later and find happiness. 

But do so slowly, by exploring what you really want to do. What are your interests, skills, passions? What things have you done in the past that you like? What would you do if money did not exist? 

Think through these questions, block out all external expectations and stay true to yourself. 

That said, don't go into debt for a degree with a low roi. Still get the degree, but at least cashflow it.

Goodluck!!"
,,,,,,,"Your only a first year. Switch your major while you still can. I was a third year criminal justice major and felt just like you, then I switched to business marketing and found the right major. I stayed an extra year in school but was worth it. I just followed my curiosities and interests. I think anything business related and economics too are enjoyable and interesting. At least a business degree will get you jobs in almost any industry when you graduate. Takes a specific type of person to do CS."
,,__wolf_7,,,,,A bit of both but mostly the programming part.
,,Rommyinla,,,,,"In the first lines of your post, you mentioned motivation and then passion. Looks like those two are the factors that are holding you back. 

The questions that you should ask yourself and nobody else (because you know your own strengths and weaknesses better) are:
1. What motivates you?
2. What do you do with passion? 
3. What are your goals/what do you want to work as? 

If you answer these questions truthfully, I think you will be able to decide on something. 

Relating to your question about Econ - If you were able to manage all the CS classes you had till now, then I would say that Econ&Business is pretty manageable too. But if you don‚Äôt like it, the loop will only repeat. You‚Äôll be ‚Äúmiserable‚Äù again.

Here are my two cents."

If you can get your leadership to sign off on you going to a school you can be exempt form your required two weeks in the summer. Not to mention unique benefits like preferential veteran hiring, VA loans, and GI Bill. If you just want to get the job training and be in and out you could sign a contract for less than 4 years if applicable. I've seen contract as short as two years.

It is a great place, in lieu of a personal website, to put all your experiences in one place. volunteer work, education, special train, etc.

Some places, like say, a window and door sales company, might want someone with less of their experience, more trainable, but brings their own demographic and character type with them.

But don't give up. If you have a school in mind speak with an advisor to go over your past credits and make a plan that fits your goals."
,,IDhl89,,,,,"Why don‚Äôt you just get a bachelor degree in engineering?

You will struggle to get into a masters and it will be very hard to excel in it without the foundation in math and physics a b.eng would give you."
,,,,,,,"Not really, but kind of.

I went this route.

But it'll take 3-5 years. You still have to take all the undergrad math and science classes which is 2-3 years. 

Then you take the major classes. Some schools will combine credits and classes for you so you start taking graduate level courses while still in undergrad and can graduate basically at the same time with your masters and undergrad, or maybe taking one extra year. 

No other real way to do it unfortunately."

,,padmeislife,,,,,highly doubt it
,,SkullAngel001,,,,,"Not likely. Being accepted into a Master's program from ANY university is a process that requires due diligence. This includes professional recommendation letter(s) from non-biased individuals (no friends or family members), a certain Bachelor degree GPA, personal statement of intent, academic writing sample, passing an entrance exam (GRE or GMAT here in the U.S.), and of course having the corresponding Bachelor's degree for an MS. 

The reason for this is because an Engineering Master's degree builds upon the STEM courses taken in an Engineering Bachelor's degree. For example, in order to successfully pass Fluid Mechanics (which is a Master's level course in Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering), you need to have passed Physics I, Calculus II & III which you would have taken in an Engineering Bachelor's degree program. The reason is because Fluid Mechanics calculations require applying single, double, and triple integration to formulas as well as knowing how to solve differential equations. 

I'm not trying to discourage you; I'm just being honest with the harsh reality of graduate-level admissions. However, I recommend you start researching the school(s) that you can possibly attend when you move overseas to determine if the admissions requirements are more favorable."

There really is no quick fix solution & it sounds like you did the best you could. I think that the pandemic is a situation that all of us are processing/have processed in our own way... I don't think we'll have a full understanding for the full impacts of it until years from now....

It might help you to take things ""one day at a time"" & to remember that even though you might feel trapped in your current situation, the future is wide open. Try to do one thing for yourself today that will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Something you will like. Something that makes you feel relaxed or mindful, like going for a walk, cooking a meal, taking a long bath or shower, etc. Eventually you will figure out the next steps for what to do next.

,,Zealousideal_Wolf560,,,,,"There will always be outsources. So it's about the place you work at - does it value it's employees? remember that skills and technical knowledge are easy to find (even fresh graduates have them) but honesty and ethics are a different thing. And good companies will try to retain their trustworthy employees. So my concern about this field isn't outsources.

What really worry me is we are too dependant to our workplace's vision on technology. As we get older as a software engineer, if the place we worked at let us to be stagnant and kept on building stuffs using old techs, even if we make money we are left behind. And when we're left behind, there really isn't much difference between a good senior coder and a good fresh graduate when you finally try to move onto a better job.

In fact being stuck means that we have to learn the new stuffs and starting at the same place as everyone else. Experience helps but since the field is so technical, even if you're experienced, if you know nothing about how the newer techs work, you know little and there's nothing that can change that until you learn about it and get a hands on practice. And no amount of being honest/pleasant to be around can hide that. Either you can contribute to the projects or you can't.

It's a lifelong learning with expiry dates and it's tiring sometimes."
,,,,,,,"I'm an engineer who had thoughts about transitioning to tech, but I have the same concerns. Although there is huge demand now for programmers (above junior level at least), I don't see it staying that way in that level in the future.

The need for so many programmers originates on a fairly large degree from mediocre startups which are not profitable and depend on VC money. This fairy tale will end soon though, as FED rises interests rates in the following months. So although the big tech will survive just fine, most other non-profitable companies will struggle and competition will be even more fierce.

Experience in engineering on the other hand is a life-long possession, it is more valuable since it is not changing so rapidly due to the vast established scientific knowledge it demands and will always be needed on a smaller or larger scale. It's a much better investment for the future. It's true that programmers earn much more right now, but the opposite was true 20 years ago and despite the very optimistic statistics highlighting the demand for programmers, I don't think that that will be exactly the case forever.

I fear that a company in a more reasonable economic environment (without that crazy VC money) will prefer a 30-year old guy with 5 YoE over a 45-year old guy with 20 YoE for the same task in a new programming framework, since experience in tech is not valued as much, only with what regards managerial positions, but nobody knows how many managers will survive, either..."

I'm a good dev, I'm very senior so my pay was not insignificant, I was making \~$150k/year. The thing is that I'm actually a very good dev, I've done this for 20+ years. So I know this job inside out but I started to hate the long hours, the amount of time I spent away from my wife and our cats. The amount of stress that I had on a daily basis, leading teams, code reviews, ensuring the servers were stable, etc. plus I was literally missing out on my life and at 43 I'd had enough. 

A new opportunity came my way about 2 years ago. I now work as a software architect for a huge company. I don't write a single line of code anymore which sometimes makes me sad but generally speaking when I leave work at 4pm everyday, that's the end of it. I can't say I love the job I'm in now but I am a lot more balanced than I used to be.

You are smart. You are hardworking. You can go out there a make and better life for yourself and be an example for your kids. You will look back on this time in a few years and see how much better you are doing and how far you've come. Join a church for support, get counseling, or just talk to family or friends. There are people who want to help you. I love you. I care about you. There are so many others around you who do too. God bless and good luck."

,,Wutislifemyguy,,,,,"I took up welding, I enjoy it.. it‚Äôs a form of art in my opinion."
,,catdoctor,,,,,"There are lots of books on the topic. There are also a lot of quizzes that you can take to help you narrow down your aptitudes and generate a list of career choices that suit your interests and personality traits. If you take these quizzes online you will have to divulge personal information and/or pay money. But you can find books and probably some quizzes for free at your local public library. If you are in school (high school or college) a guidance counselor can help you with a lot of resources. If you are no longer in school, you could find out if the school you most recently attended could make some of these resources available to you.

Once you have a list of jobs that sound like they might be interesting, you could do ""informational interviews."" You contact people who have the job you'd like to know more about. You can start by asking friends and relatives if they know anyone who does X for a living. Look as online want ads. Cold-call companies that employ the people you are looking for and ask f there is someone you can contact. (I got the most interesting and unlikely job I've ever had by finding someone on a list of city government offices in the phone book. This was before the Internet was invented.)

Contact the person by phone, e-mail or letter and ask for 30 minutes of their time. Tell them you want to talk about their job. Most people are happy to help out a young person and everyone likes talking about themselves, so it's unlikely that you will get a lot of (if any) rejections. Show up on time for these meetings. Dress appropriately for the work environment. Have a 30-second introduction: ""My name is (your name), I have completed (highest level of education). I'm currently exploring career options and I'm interested in the work that you do because (one sentence about what seems interesting about the job, how it fits your goals and aptitudes, and/or why you think you might be good at it.)

Have a list of open-ended questions to ask about that person's work:

\- How did you decide to do this for a living?

\- What do you like most about this job?

\- Can you briefly describe what a typical day at work is like for you?

\- What do you like the least about this job? Or: What are the biggest challenges in this job?

\- After you started doing this work, what surprised you about it?

\- What training and what personality traits make a person well-suited to this kind of work?

\- What advice would you give to a young person interested in doing this work?

Your last question should ALWAYS be: 

\- Can you suggest someone else in your field or a related field that I should be talking to?

This last one is how you build a network. Get the person's name and contact information. Many interviewees will offer to broker an introduction at this point.

Watch the clock! Stick to your 30 minutes unless the interviewee specifically invites you to talk longer. 

Follow up with a brief e-mail or note thanking them for their time."
,,Neel_LifeCoach,,,,,"Hi

Your question has several parts in that.

1. Career depends on your qualifications, experience and your desires.
2. You mentioned having no idea what you want to do with your life. I guess you must be someone young with probably not having anyone's responsibility, right now. With age and responsibility of caring for those under your care, to pay a rent or to ensure education of children, all these direct very creative and motivating factors in driving the person to find what is best to be done under the circumstances.
3. Yes, most people start with a job, and keep hopping till they get what they want. 

I hope these help.

I work in trucking management now, but was a driver for almost a decade. It requires long hours and a lot of patience, and the primary way people get into the industry is by signing a year-long contract with the low-paying predatory over-the-road motor carriers to pay for training.

If you can stick out a year, year and a half of being away from home a month at a time dealing with New Jersey or L.A. traffic and living on truck stop food, you can then get a home-daily job.

I‚Äôm in a very low cost of living area. My company requires a year of verifiable tractor-trailer experience, but the lowest-earning full-time driver at my location makes about $1000/week before taxes. Some of the harder-working drivers here make upwards of $1300-1500/week."

The company I contracted with for my first year put me up in a crappy apartment with 3 other dudes I'd never met before for 3 weeks of CDL school, then paired me with a trainer to spend 4 weeks living in the truck with him while getting trained.

A little arithmetic is the only education-related skill you'll need, to calculate transit times and hours of service (though modern trucks have electronic logs that keep track of your hours for you, and you can refer to a trucker-specific GPS for estimated transit times nowadays). Oh, and the ability to read a map - but they teach that in the CDL school.

If you are willing to, you can stick it out until you've passed your probationary period and can take time allotted to you, or you can just hope they don't fire you if you take time before that. If they do fire you, you can probably collect unemployment (I'm assuming you're in the US, if not I don't know how unemployment works in other countries). Don't be afraid of getting fired. It isn't a huge deal when looking for a new job, you don't necessarily have to disclose that you were terminated from a job you were at for less than 6 months anyway."
,,SkullAngel001,,,,,"While I admire your work work tenacity and professionalism, the issue at hand is the toxic environment you're trying to leave. In other words, there's nothing wrong with job hunting while working as you're trying to do what's best for you. 

You can go to an interview during your lunch break if the prospective employer agrees, or take your lunch late (1-2pm) and just say you need to run some errands (if the new employer can't meet during your lunch hour). 

Do phone interviews in your car but leave your employer's premises (go to an open area like a shopping plaza parking lot). 

Basically it just comes down to being stealthy and not letting your employer suspect anything. If you need to leave for an interview during non-lunch hours, just make up an excuse (getting car serviced, picking someone up at the airport, meeting with your tax guy, doctor's appointment, etc.) but don't leave so much that it draws attention to yourself."

I've always had an hour long lunch break at my disposal and always had flexibility in my start/end time, so I've never been in  this kind of situation before."

My recommendation would be to get your sub-teaching cert. Then take a two-week vacation from your current job and pick up every sub math teaching gig you can get.   


If you love teaching over that time then consider getting fully licensed and switching to a much lower paying job which may bring you more happiness."
,,acroporaguardian,,,,,"Education has bullshit too by the way.

I wanted to be an academic and now work in private sector. Corporate bullshit is better than ""administrator with power"" bullshit.

I taught at two schools. The first job ended because they hired someone with less education than me for a full time teaching job because his family was connected to the powers that be in the state. I used to walk by his class and listen to him talk before I left - it was a real self esteem kick to listen to this clown get chosen over me.

You know what the worst part was? They weren't going to tell me that I wasn't being renewed. The only reason I found out with enough time to find another teaching job was a professor that I was friends with told me they announced it in their private faculty only meeting. 

I have spent 6+ years in corporate bullshit and once you learn to adjust to it, you can find ways to mentally survive. Of course, key is saving as much money as possible so if you do want to quit and be a teacher, you could."

So its like, as someone capable of doing well in a corporate environment, why would i risk having some resentful administrator control my future?

,,000011111111,,,,,"Public education in the United States specifically special education which is what I was teaching. Is a completely broken system. And  as a teacher I was powerless to fix it. And blamed for problems that were out of my control. I was expected to work 60-hour weeks and the first to be thrown under the bus for social and environmental problems that were out of my control but affected students on my case load.

I also taught math. I had 172 students. Which was way too many to be able to meet each one of their needs individually. Effectively.

On the tech side of things I have so much more autonomy over my schedule and day to day life. And that brings me so much more happiness. I'm always the hero when I implement technical solutions that solve people's problems. That brings me lots of happiness.

If I show up 30 minutes late to work nobody cares. There's not a classroom full of students waiting for me to teach.

Financially speaking I'll be able to retire in 1/3 the amount of time. If I choose to. My compensation is that much better working in technology.

Don't take my perspective as your own though. It's my story. And happiness manifests in different ways for different people.

Are you in the United States? Are you looking at teaching in public or private schools? University or high school or middle school?"
,,Bulky_Aardvark_1335,,,,,"Thanks for your perspective. I live in the US. I had always thought about being a high school teacher. I have only been exposed to my own schooling experience which was at a high quality public school.

I also like the level of autonomy that comes in setting your own schedule in this kind of work, solving people's technical problems, and the salary potential in the industry. Maybe it is a grass is always greener on the other side kinda deal, especially with the fact that life is shut down now so I can't fully live outside of work as I would otherwise.

Most of my experience has been with more middle school aged kids actually. Now that I think about it, another option i have is dedicating more of my time as a volunteer tutor camp counselor etc. as the world opens up. I definitely understand the benefits and potential of this line of work and want to be very careful and strategic about a potential transition to something else."

I'm not saying that you should do this but my ""training"" of a replacement would probably have just enough truth to look like I was legitimately doing it but a LOT of disinformation thrown in along the way.  It's so disgusting that a company would do this to an existing employee that it's just hard to comprehend. 

You generally shouldn't leave a job without another job but I'd be so tempted regardless of my personal situation to simply tell the company outright ""No"" and be let go immediately and then draw unemployment -- I think the benefits are even being supplemented in the USA via the federal government due to the pandemic.  

Is this in the USA and is it to train a non-citizen to replace you?  If so, can you name the company for public shaming?"

,,mlcarson,,,,,"What do you want to DO?   Academically, they lump these topics into similar categories but they aren't in the real world.   You should figure out what they are all about by  looking at a course catalog and maybe sampling a class if you do think its something you want to do.

 Do you see yourself as a programmer or an IT worker?   These are very different professions.    Finance is going to put you in accounting work to start off with.  Statistics is probably going to lead to a job working with big data sets and coming up with some meaningful information for management.  Mathematics in college usually starts at the Calculus level which you won't use for much in the real world unless you find a career in science/engineering.

Computer science is what I majored in but back in the day it was mainly about programming methodologies/software design/databases/operating systems.   I basically used it as a stepping stone into IT, Networking, & Security.  There are tons of different type of jobs related to computer technology.   It's also a field where the government encourages businesses to outsource or utilize the H1B foreign labor force to suppress wages and to eliminate the need for American workers so keep that in mind.   Ageism is rampant and unlike most fields where your value increases with experience, that doesn't happen beyond a certain point  in a computer profession.  Things change so frequently that you literally can't have over a certain amount of experience in relevant technologies.   Older people are often seen as being resistant to change and that where the ageism starts.   Don't go into this field for what looks like good money -- if you're really in it for the money then find a track into management. There's much more to be had there."

Also if he needs you then  try and leverage that.  Also if the company is not doing well then maybe his goal is to make you a contract and pay you for only the hours of work so say in a day he can argue you only did 4 hours of work or so on... 
Don‚Äôt agree to 1099 let him fire you and apply to unemployment while you search for work.  

Or if you want the money badly if you are 1099 then you decide everything when to work your schedule work form home and so on because since he is not your employer he is not able to determine those things .

,,CosmicMetamorphisis,,,,,"Pretty simple solution. If let‚Äôs say you give one month and have to pay one month‚Äôs salary, determine how long you have to work the new job to make that amount back based on commissions. If your commissions double your first month‚Äôs salary then it is one month. If 50%, 2 months. If 10%, 10 months. That is the cost of changing jobs. The actual math will depend on your situation. 

But you have to consider too, with a 20% pay raise, that becomes another cost of leaving. Can you guarantee 20%+ commissions from the new job consistently? Can you cover that and recoup the cost of leaving early?"
,,fmeyer_98,,,,,"1. How confident are you that you will succeed in the new position?
2. Looking back at this moment ten years from now what would you regret more? Taking the job with the risk of losing some money but gaining experience or staying with what you are familiar with, never knowing what could have happened? 
3. To me, it sounds that the role at the new job is more appealing to you... would you be more fulfilled there?"
,,FocusMission86,,,,,"First off, how did you start in your old company? Did they also promise that you wouldn't do as much but the workload still grew gradually? I am asking because this might also be the case for your new role. 

Of course every recruiter and hiring manager would sell the position to you in the beginning as is the case in most, especially if you have an impressive resum√©. Second, how is the commission structure? Is it something that is easily attainable or is it something that you can only hit if you work your ass off?

You may be frustrated with how they're handling some aspects of the business but think about the culture in general. I once left a job for higher pay and better title, only to find out that it was a toxic environment and much of the freedom and decision making I used to enjoy back in my old job is just not possible with this one because their employees work in silos and there is not much room for collaboration and generally, new ideas are frowned upon.

Think about this carefully before you decide.

Another thing, not hitting the quota can leave you in a bad light as opposed to having a job with no commission so you also don't feel as much pressure."
,,lythius21,,,,,"Thanks for your response. I am confident I'd be able earn more as I am currently doing a lot more work and generating a lot of revenue, none of which goes to my pocket. I just feel a little pinched at giving my company 1 month's pay."
,,lythius21,,,,,"The commission structure is basically 10% on everything I generate, so there's no quota and if I hit a certain threshold above 150k it becomes 15%. Seems pretty easy to attain in my opinion.

,,tt4n,,,,,"Losing an account  is really tough,  but as some others mentioned there are clear steps you can take 

1. Ring your ex-customer, and ask them to provide honest and open feedback on the process from them  signing to them not renewing. Be professional and don't take it personally.  Their feedback is really important  and will also help you pin point that you didn't have the tools required from your boss for them  to succeed. Make it clear you will be taking this feedback seriously  and implementing it to better your process. 

2. Create a clear plan from signing the agreement, to completion  of the process with your boss. Agree what is sold and what you are promising. Agree with your client regular catch ups. You mentioned your boss said you didn't need regular phone  calls with every client. He's wrong- if open communication was established with this client,  with a defined review / zoom call, this might not have happened 

3. Go on a huge audit with your current clients.  When this happens it ensures you have that 'must not slip up mentality ' at the front of your mind. Check your client projects  (it cannot be true you can't see what the client sees if if is a Web page). Schedule zoom calls with all clients near completion and implement their feedback. 

4. Present all of these back to your boss. Don't overly apologise, but rather state and show your next steps"

,,PutSimply1,,,,,"The workplace is really interesting and annoying

Many workplaces rely on the idea that the majority of their workforce is happy with a 2% pay rise per year, they really rely on this ( very shallow but there it is ) 

""To get the promotions you must fight for it"" - this is what they tell you

BY FAR... the most common way I've seen people getting a promotion is by looking elsewhere, getting an offer from another place, and then using it as a means to get a counteroffer from your current company 

It's really sad that this is the case, but it seems to be common 

You'd think your company would value you to the point where it encourages you to stay but they seem to not do that 

My advice is to continue to look elsewhere and become comfortable with the possibility of moving 

Equally, I don't know if you're in charge of a process that only you know or something but leaving when this is the case is funny because they don't realise how badly they can shoot themselves in the foot  

But yes, sucky situation, I know companies do this, I'm actually involved in hiring and it's annoying to say, but thinking like this \^ is taught, only true leaders ignore it and champion their own employees, regular managers will just do it and....it's these people I have no time for

,,Tiny_Persimmon4305,,,,,"The NGO world is tough! Graduates are often not too prepared with the skills needed for this field, and it takes alot of trial and error and not-so-great roles until you learn to navigate it. 

My advice is to stock up on skills needed for working in a typical, project-based organization. Skills in finance management, budget management, project management, IT, data science, etc. 

NGOs operate like any other organization would, except they're usually lower on resources since they don't produce anything that will generate profit. 

Industry specific skills that are GOLD in this field include proposal development, stakeholder management, communications, humanitarian project management (check out PM4NGO), monitoring and evaluation, etc. 

I'm currently getting licensed in Project Management and getting some stats skills down - I wish I knew this while studying because honestly scrambling to get these skills in place when you're starting to work makes it very hard to get a guaranteed job, or one that will live up to the expectations you had while studying for years. 

I also personally wish I'd held off on my masters until after I got a few years of work experience and technical skills down (got an MSc in Human Rights and another in Psychology). While useful of course, I probably would have gone for something a little more technical (i.e. humanitarian program management or humanitarian health or something similar for example). 

Also there's such a wide range of sectors you can 'specialize' in. MHPSS, education, food and livelihood, community development, shelter, WASH, etc. I'd look at UN Humanitarian Needs Overview reports and similar resources. These reports usually give you great insight into how the industry sectors are organized. Some NGOs work exclusively in one sector while others work in a wide variety. 

Seems like a lot I know, but really I'd say narrow your focus a little to what type of work you want to do in this field and maybe whay general area you like (sectors above). 

Look for free training courses online (Kaya humanitarian aid, Save the Children, edX, even YouTube). If you want to take it a step further get some certifications from whats listed above and start building those skills here and there. There's lots of resources but requires a little digging! 

Also see the guides like the internationally recognized Sphere handbook for minimum best practice in humanitarian aid as a good general reference for how NGOs generally have to meet criteria for working with vulnerable populations. 

With your background in Law, contract management and similar types of work are also good skills to develop, every NGO needs legal support - especially international ones working cross border. 

Good luck!"

,,matt_moneytalk,,,,,"I'm not sure what the right answer is but I'll just write down what's going through my mind. 

1. If I needed a job but haven't had any luck in 4 months I'd probably take ANY job that pays decent, however, I'd still wouldn't take a job that I'd be miserable at. 
2. If I didn't take this job, what could I be doing right now that would get me closer to my goal. If the answer is nothing then it seems like the job isn't hurting me.
3. If I took a job that didn't align with my career goals, I'd still be applying for jobs with a better fit and hopefully be active in organizations and/or volunteer opportunities that were closer to the industry I wanted.
4. I personally don't see any issue with career pivots.... Also, I've never hired anyone but I'd guess, hiring manager's main concern is if you have the right skills to solve their problems, not the name of the company (I could be wrong though)."
,,TTeiZZ,,,,,"No-one is going to look down on you for having a job like this during a pandemic.
If it is a well known company with a good reputation then you can easily embellish your role on your resume about soft skills etc. Eg. Liaising with stakeholders (very important in environmental work); conflict resolution; teamwork; customer service and other such nonsense.

It will also grow your network (most important thing in life career wise) and allows you to apply internally. Just treat everyone you work with with respect, decency and a can do attitude. You never know what that contact might lead to.

Always remember that in this day and age, every job is temporary and you should give your employer as much loyalty as they give you.  And just about any role can be spun or exploited in your own benefit, it's all about thinking outside the box.

If all else fails, remember that you can just quit, and it doesn't even have to exist on your resume if you don't want it to.

These are my two cents, good luck making your decision."
,,seable9,,,,,"My thought based past experience:

1. The company name will be important for your future career. If you stay in a certain industry, and you got an industry leading company on your resume, your future jobs are secured. If you went out that leading company industry, the name of company become less helpful, however a good company is good for a reason, so your experience will still be useful.

2. You can‚Äôt plan your career.... these days world change fast, what you think want to do now probably will change when you are 20 years in...

I have a Master degree in engineering, and now in sales, won‚Äôt have planed that at all...."

,,SkullAngel001,,,,,"Well a Ph.D. is designed FOR Academia. You eat, sleep, breathe, and sh\*t your discipline because Ph.D.'s do research day in and day out, publish their research, and teach. It just so happens that some companies hire applicants with a Ph.D.

However the job positions for MBA's and Ph.D.'s are higher up such as Director of XXXX or VP of XXXX.  And in order to land a job as a VP or Director, you often need previous job experience + your graduate degree. 

If you apply for something entry or mid-level, your graduate degree would make you overqualified and thus a higher chance of being passed over for an applicant whose qualifications are just right.

It's not common to hire someone who is overly-educated with zero job experience for an upper level position so I'd say skip the Ph.D. and hit the job market.  You can always come back and get your Ph.D. after you've worked 3-5 years in your industry (which is the correct business degree path as your grad thesis is tied to your career work)."

If my game got any success, like enough to live off of for a bit but not the rest of my life, I'd quit and become a teacher.

,,Embarrassed_Onion421,,,,,"I just wanted to throw it out there that for veterinarian, you will need to take (for most vet schools) two semesters of general chemistry, 1-2 semesters organic chemistry, 2 semesters physics, 2 semesters general biology, microbiology, and often biochemistry, genetics, upper level anatomy and physiology, statistics and/or calculus. Some schools also want nutrition and more upper level science courses (ie parasitology, histology, etc) 

Unless you took some or most of these while getting your bachelors (seems unlikely since it is a b.a in liberal arts) you are looking at at least 2 years of full-time classes, if not more, to complete the pre-reqs (and if you don't have all the pre-reqs done or at least in progress on last semester, your application is in the rejected pile)

On top of that, you want veterinary hours (hours spent shadowing/working with veterinarians) and animal hours (hours spent working/volunteering with animals) and ideally, at least for vet hours, that needs to be with small animal vets, lab animal vets, large animal vets, etc. They want to see variety of experience, and usually 200-300 hours is sort of the unspoken minimum for vet experience, but lots of applicants have worked full-time at vet clinics as veterinary techs (the equivalent of a human nurse) or veterinary assistants (equivalent of human medical assistant) and have 1000s and 10,000s hours.

Hopefully this helps rule vet med in or out for you. 

Vet tech is a two year program, but registered vet techs make peanuts compared to their human nurse equivalents, and it is a really physical and messy job (restraining fractious /aggressive animals to draw blood, nail trim, so the vet can get urine), lifting 50lb+ dogs with someone else, getting bitten, scratches, peed, pooped, bad vomited on. Having to do anal gland expressions and it getting on your scrubs.)

I've worked at a small vet clinic as a vet assistant and receptionist, and I'm intersted in vet school. 

For a vet, after completing 4 years of veterinary school ( and obtaining often 200k+ debt) I've seen starting salaries on indeed local to me ranging from as low as 35/40k to around 65-75k."

You want to be ""on the right side of market power."" You want to be in a field where the workers have more market power than average. 

There are a few ways to get this. The most straightforward is a union job. The hardest is to study something that its in demand and is also difficult to complete. The difficulty creates a barrier of entry that is a lot like union protection.

I work in a small field, model risk management. I got type cast into it. I was a Data Scientist, got a background in statistics. But lo and behold, here I am. 

Its not my favorite job but I am good at it. Most people with my education don't want to write documents (we also do statistics stuff, but far less than a data scientist would do daily). So the result is I can probably always find a job. 

Opportunities for advancement are next to none and most aspire to be a senior and thats it.

I might ask them about the gaps specifically and what the advancement path to senior looks like so it is clear from the beginning.  Does the lack of senior title limit the scope of what you get to work on?  Does this specific company / team / role allow you to learn something you never could in your current role that only makes you more marketable overall?

,,sharknado523,,,,,"This really varies by company. At my current company each role type sort of has a baseline base salary. So if you go from a role that has one classification to another the compensation simply goes from your current compensation to that. Then any merit raises are simply based on annual reviews.

However, I work at a large corporation that heavily standardizes (to a fault) this process. Without knowing much more about the role, 15% doesn't sound like an unreasonable increase, though you haven't said what exactly you make in order to judge the impact. I started college with a job that paid a base salary of $30,000/year. My first raise was to $36,000/year which was a 20% raise. You give the same raise to somebody that makes $100,000/year and it's only a 6% raise. The employer cares more about the dollars than the percentage, and in truth ""% raise"" is really just a vanity statistic, IMHO (except for its ability to inform generally (albeit not perfectly) about the purchasing power of the new salary in upcoming months/years)"

I would do it in whatever app your company usually uses for meetings. If they do video calls I think that would be best. Next best I think is a voice call. It's probably nicer if they can see your face, but we didn't typically have webcam on.

I think email might be too impersonal unless you know for sure your boss prefers it.

Find something that interests you. Anything. Ants. Animals. Books. Fitness. Food. Something, that, when you (used to) walk into a bookstore you head right for this section. Art. Healing. Space. Metals. 
Then find out everything you can about it. Become an expert. You can do this when you are working any type of job, just be patient and don't give up. Then you will develop questions.  Maybe even questions that you can't find an answer to no matter how hard you try-Ask people who are already experts ( going to school offers a great opportunity for this but it is by no means the only way and it is easy to reach out to almost anyone via email these days, plus Kahn academy etc.) you want to answer or hear about someone's life that interests you -and you will find the  best path for you -for now- but don't forget also that often being on one path can sometimes take you to places you didn't think possible.

And it sounds like you would really benefit from some time doing something -anything different just tk get your confidence back before you embark on whatever new path you choose. Also it might be the right time to consider working with a vocational coach. I'm sure that you can find a good one there in Berlin. Both politics (at their best, anyway) and counseling involve a lot of focus on others and what their needs are. Folks in our profession tend to forget that it is even possible, much less desirable, to seek career guidance ourselves.  What you have been through sounds very traumatic-at least to me. I may be projecting but having my entire 'tribe' gang up against me and eject me would be devastating.  
Find a center or coach for adult vocational guidance and let them help you-i think it could make all the difference for you.  
I am pulling for you, and hoping you will find all the support and help you need to find a way to engage in work that is productive, meaningful, and healthy for you!

,,betscgee,,,,,"So is higher education as expensive as here in the US? I always think of Germany-all of Europe, really, being more enlightened than the US-I am a social worker -got my masters in 1982! Back then tuition was affordable even going into a career like social work. I don't know how anyone does it now. Tuition is unbelievably expensive here-
It sounds like you have been knocked down and dragged around and feel discouraged and I don't blame you. Maybe what you need now is just a bit of a sabbatical -just a break where you put all the career concerns on hold for 6 months or so-and maybe get some counseling or coaching. Let yourself receive some care and nurturing for a change. 
There will be a lot to learn from all you've been through but you need time to process it all. 
Sometimes you just become exhausted -especially working in stressful environments like politics or counseling. Even trying some mindfulness -based stress reduction.

But if you switch after 3 semesters for no urgent reason, then you loos state support for studying, so that's why this road is now closed for me.

Also living in Berlin (especially the rent) is really expensive, so I have to work. And if I work that much, I won't have time to study anymore and it will take me forever to finish my bachelor's degree.

I also came out of 1 1/2 year of beeing sick and living of state support and I really don't want to ""waste"" any more time although I didn't political work from my home in that time. Things like this don't get you a degree or any money.

,,,,,,,"Uni itself is just 300‚Ç¨/month, but since I switched from computer science after the 5 semester, I won't get any State support anymore, and that means I have to pay everything else by myself.

I really don't want to be 33 when I'm going into my first job."
,,Zarni1410,,,,," Oh yes, it is really expensive in Berlin. For the school and expenses part, you can always try for scholarships abroad. Afaik, if you want to gain admission in China for a post grad taught in English degree, they even will give you a stipend so that you don't have to worry about anything. They just really want international students. Some of my acquaintances have done that.                                                                     
For me, I was really lost for a period in my life. I graduated high school in my country and I went to uni in my country. I quit in freshman year because turns out uni in my country is shite and its something i can't see myself pursuing for the next 4 years of my life. However, my high school degree is not recognized in any other country. So, I worked hard for a scholarship to essentially go back to high school abroad so that I could study abroad. It hurts a bit when I will and am still be worrying about grades while my friends are starting their careers and some even marrying but man, we only have one shot at this. We only have one life. Its never too late to work towards the life you want I do hope it goes well for you my friend, I really do hope you can find something that suits you well and you do something plausible.

,,Red_Sheep89,,,,,"What do you like to do?

If you really don't know, try a lot of different things. Volunteering can help you with that. 

You're still young, and while the choices you make now are important for the future, that doesn't mean your path will be set in stone.

Personally, I have tried many different things, such as bartending, farm-hand, teaching, translating, working in a purchase department in the food industry, and I ended up with a bachelor in business and a masters in translation. Today, I'm a business analist. It wasn't before I was 28 that I found the type of job that I liked, and it took another 2 years before I found a company I was happy to work for.

So right now IT is something I see myself working in for another few years, but I'm planning on diversifying soon."
,,,,,,,"I think you should volunteer at a dental or medical office. See how you like it. You need to be good at science and some math to become a dentist or medical doctor. I‚Äôm not sure what your strongest subjects are, that‚Äôs for you to assess. You might change your mind a few times when you start college and that‚Äôs okay. College science classes are different from high school, so gauge what you‚Äôre good at and not good at. Also, if you love animals volunteer at a vet clinic. Maybe you can get over your phobias, maybe not. But you have to try some people are able to get over them. I forgot volunteering at a hospital could be good too. I would‚Äôve loved to be a vet but I‚Äôm not smart enough for that. I thought about being a vet tech but I‚Äôm not strong enough to lift up animals and im like you. I didnt want the vet to tell me what to do. I‚Äôd rather actually do the job.

im better at liberal arts than I am math and science. I thought about becoming an animal or environmental lawyer. You try that too but law school is very expensive, you don‚Äôt get paid much, it‚Äôs stressful with long hours and job projects can be üëéüèΩ Lol. But many people still graduate and find a good job, just depends on the rank of your law school. But legal is very competitive And was hit hard by the last recession. Never completely recovered. I studied lib arts (legal studies) and have a hard time getting a job at a law office or any office. I know there‚Äôs a pandemic but still. Many other that‚Äôs studied stem were able to get a job while I am a year into the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù graduated university with a bs and still haven‚Äôt found a job, whatever you choose to volunteer and intern in that field. You can no longer just graduate with a degree and call it a day. You need experience. Some jobs don‚Äôt even require a degree.

im actually trying to switch into the IT field because I‚Äôve always liked technology and was/is good at it. You can always PM me if you want. I know this is long but I hope it helps. I wish people gave me this advice when I was young. High school counselors and college advisors were somewhat...not helpful lol."

I absolutely love organizing things, when I‚Äôm in the mood."
,,Red_Sheep89,,,,,"Well I'd say try out stuff! You could volunteer at an animal shelter or something, every experience is a good experience.

As far as bosses are concerned... There's a big chance you will always have someone who tells you what to do, but sometimes it's enough to have the freedom to decide how you do it. The key is to find a boss you like! I get along really well with my current one

Stick to a job that I'm not cut out for?,jopzj7,theconfusedlemur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/jopzj7/stick_to_a_job_that_im_not_cut_out_for/,3,1,1604606822.0,
,,Joshboulderer3141,,,,,"This is very common, particularly in tech.  Graduating from a university shows an employer and/or company that you have the ability to pick up on new material.  But there are many other aspects to being successful in a career such as- being able to blend in with the culture, being able to perform and deliver within tight deadlines, being able to lead a diverse team of people, bouncing back from mistakes (sometimes costly ones at that).  It almost takes an entrepreneurial mindset and a good deal of external motivation to be successful.  But these skills can be gained-you can take classes at a community college directly relating to the projects your working on, you can seek a mentor outside of your job whom you can get advice from, you can attend seminars and talks (or even give talks) of the projects your working on, you can become a part of clubs that will expand on your skills.  

Again, I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs easy.  But particularly true in tech- you are always going to be learning new things and the learning that is involved doesn‚Äôt end with a degree.  Also true in tech, there are always going to challenges to overcome, big or small.  Mistakes will be made.  My advice would be to stick to the job you currently have because it is a good opportunity to learn new things, gain a more optimistic perspective, and to make a positive impact on society.  Likely, the next job you get will be even less related to your major- I kind of know from experience.  Good luck!"

I believe when I got my offer for my current company they told me to take ""a few days."" I feel like 3 is the max. When I got my promotion it took longer to sign the letter because there were errors in it and signing the offer required me to sign the new NCA which took legal like weeks to draw up, lol.

When you get your offer the ‚Äúagonizing over whether you want this job or not‚Äù should essentially be done and you should only be checking if the contract meets your expectations enough for you to make the move. And maybe sorting out questions or challenges on unexpected details that were NOT discussed in the interview (like benefits package and notice periods). But the bigger questions should be done, and if you read your contract right away the questions on the details shouldn‚Äôt take long to put together if you know what you want.

For instance, I used to work at a liquor store, now I work as a merchandiser for a wine and liquor distributor. I go around to liquor stores and build displays. It pays way better than retail. Hopefully I will eventually get a sales route at my company which pays even more.

There are merchandisers in other industries too, like for grocery stores and clothing and probably other stuff. My advice is to search for merchandiser or merchandizing in a job search if that interests you.

Otherwise look into any type of sales job."

,,blueopera,,,,,"I hope they don't ask the ""worst qualities"" question. As an interviewer, I really dislike it because few people actually answer honestly. The internet guidance tells you to pick something that ultimately is a positive (e.g. I work too hard!) that it's just a silly waste of a question. The goal of the question is to understand where you might need some extra support, training, or mentoring, and to identify if their work environment is the right fit for you and vice versa."
,,NTDP1994,,,,,"Hi! 

Take my point with the grain of salt you should take from the opinion of an online stranger.

Best qualities: dedication and motivation are always good examples
Worst qualities: taking criticism a bit personally. I usually say this and that I see my work as an extension of myself and that I have been working to improve, saying that I know that when criticism is made, it's because the other person wants the work to be in its best form, which is something I also want.

Regarding etiquette:
Be fully professionally dressed, no sweatpants (just in case)
No audible background noise (earphones are acceptable, make sure they have a mic)
Good background, with good lighting


Good luck!!"
,,DanDangerx,,,,,"Take some time to practice the positioning of the camera not too close, not too far, make sure your upper body and face is in view, legs not essential. 


Still dress as you would for any other in person interview. You dont have to get up but things are not always in your control to stay seated and you dont want to be caught with pjs on your lower half. 


Make the background as neutral and professional as possible with a balanced amount of lighting. The focus is to be on you not on whats going on behind  or around you

I hope this helps and best of luck. Others may have other tips but this is what sticks out in my mind for vid interviews."
,,iceyone444,,,,,"1 - Don't look at this as life/death - think about it as a great opportunity where you are having a discussion, learning more about the company and hopefully getting a position you want.

2 - Review the job ad and how you fit into the role - provide examples of how/when you can do the role.

3 - Ask lots of questions

4 - As for the best/worst qualities - this depends on the role and my skillset - you may not even be asked the question.

Most of all - good luck!"
,,ReynoldRaps,,,,,"As someone who has interviewed a ton over zoom I second for you to test your lighting, cam position and mic today. Join a few mins early even if in the zoom waiting. The lighting and cam really impact your first impression. 

Also it is tougher to read body language over a zoom panel interview. So make sure on all questions to stay focused and don‚Äôt hesitate to pause and ask if they have questions or would like you to clarify a point. Need to introduce new ways in the zoom world of interviews to keep the connectivity and the detail at right level. 

Last never forget the STAR method of interviews. Most if not all questions you can use this acronym to keep your response to the point with the right story arch you start with explaining the Situation then move to the Task you led towards it and the specifics Actions you took to make the impact and the Results those efforts showed. Just live in STAR land I tell ppl and you‚Äôll beat most on the basics."
,,PhilWham,,,,,"I doubt you'll get a worst qualities, but you may get a ""weaknesses"" one something like what would your current manager say is your biggest weakness?

This is usually a question of self-awareness and how you overcome your own weaknesses. Here are some examples. 

- I Generally focus on the minute details and processes of things, however the past year I've worked on zooming out by talking to a different manager once a week to understand big picture. 

- I have limited technical experience with your company's cerain program, however I have worked with similar systems. 

- I don't have experience in this industry YET, but I have been doing research, talked with these people, and have worked on these existing transferrable skills go make the adjustment

- I can be introverted, BUT I combat that by making a goal once a week to reach out to someone in the company regarding a goal, work problem, or career question."

,,mintjubilee,,,,,"I think for your best qualities/greatest strengths, it's a good idea to review the job description. Highlight/jot down all of the parts where your brain goes *I would be perfect at that!*

Then spend a few minutes and for each one, ask yourself why. Why would you be great that particular thing? You can probably have these in note form. If/when the question comes up, choose the answers that you have not yet addressed in the interview. Some of them you may have already discussed, so make sure to flesh yourself out for them and why you really want the job."
,,CommandoLamb,,,,,"Not the same thing, but had a guy answer a question about a time when you or someone on your team made a mistake and how did you handle it with and I quote,

""I've never made a mistake.""

From that moment on the hiring manager stopped asking questions for the duration of the interview because he was immediately ruled out.

She let the other interview finish with their questions and then let him on his way.

But seriously, I've been asked this question and instead of a positive I usually give honest feedback and what I've done to correct it.

But it's a stupid question honestly."
,,DanDangerx,,,,,Also make sure the audio and videofeed of the device works beforehand. It gets a bit awkward spending the first 5 minutes trying to make it work.

Your approach to the question is spot on. It shows you recognize an area of improvement and have proactively worked to improve. That's the type of initiative you want to see in an employee."
,,mintjubilee,,,,,"I'm a risk averse person, so I've answered this question in the past with discussing ways I set up a system to *prevent* a mistake or to *catch* a mistake quickly. (i.e. a spreadsheet with clear calculations and sourced numbers that allowed us to quickly figure out exactly where a final number had gone wrong - prior to this, nobody recorded the steps of the calculation for these numbers so if one had been wrong, they would have had to start over from the beginning).

Is this an appropriate response, or does it sound arrogant/miss the mark as well?"
,,CommandoLamb,,,,,"So if you unfortunately get this question, I think finding an example of a mistake is key.

You can be risk averse and account for everything. Mistakes still happen.

We are all humans, nature is still random, mistakes happen.

Think of a genuine mistake, but don't think of something like,

""Well, when I was working at the water park, I was the life guard on duty and I started talking to this girl and I forgot to watch the pool and a kid drowned.""

Think of a mistake that may not have been hugely critical, or maybe not even 100% your fault.

Own it as a mistake. Make it clear that it was definitely not what was supposed to happen, and then explain what you did afterwards.

How did you overcome the mistake?

But what they are looking for is for you to admit that mistakes can happen and what you do after mistakes are made.

Did you fix the problem or did you shut down and call for help and bail."

,,momboss79,,,,,"Yes! I went to school to be a dental hygienist. I worked for two years and then started a family. When my oldest started school, I didn‚Äôt really want to go back in the dental field so I thought long and hard and changed my career.

I enjoy what I do. I didn‚Äôt enjoy what I did before. I liked it ok but I didn‚Äôt enjoy the dentists I worked for. I kept finding offices managed poorly and there was a lot of drama, bad behavior.. high school type drama. 
I never really fit in and felt like I was always an outsider because I never could find a good place that was a good fit for me. 
The first place I worked when my daughter was starting school was as a data entry clerk. I didn‚Äôt really need to work a high paying job (my husband was the bread winner at the time) so I worked somewhere that was hiring and doing something I had never done before. I expressed my interest in going back to school pretty early on in my employment and was told that I would eventually qualify for tuition reimbursement through the company if I was there long enough. So I stayed. I got my MBA, they paid for it and I was quickly moved up into an accounting position. I‚Äôve been at the same company for 15 years and I‚Äôm now the Director of Finance. When I tell people I started out as a hygienist, they think that‚Äôs SO cool but ya know - I think what I do now takes the cake. It‚Äôs also financially rewarding and I don‚Äôt deal with drama anymore. 

You have to do something that you like, that excites you, challenges you and will have a long term reward.

At my last job, I had moved to a state that my family, and I were not happy in.

During my time there, I took up a few new hobbies and found renewed interest in a few old  hobbies which I could do on my computer at work (we could bring in our own computers). My boss was really cool about me this too. 

However, I did not feel any growth at all the time I was with the company. There was little to no training, and no real incentive to pursue professional development (I did motivate myself to get my Bachelors while working there). There was absolutely no room for advancement. 

In fact, I got passed over when my boss left, and I applied for his position. I was senior employee in our office, have a bachelors in business administration, and 15 years‚Äô experience in our field. What did they do, they hired someone from outside the company to take his place. That was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I applied for a job with another company in another state, and four weeks in I am very glad I made the decision to move on.

The reason I ask - 50% of roles in top tech companies are ‚Äúnon-technical,‚Äù and sales reps are often among the highest-paid employees in tech. What's more, the best sales reps, according to industry leaders, come from ""non-traditional"" backgrounds. What‚Äôs more, more and more tech companies are embracing remote work, especially now with the pandemic.

As tech is influencing the world and evergrowing, especially future-proof, I enrolled in **Flockjay** which is a 10 week Monday. - Thursday 5 pm - 8 pm live remote (via Zoom) modern tech sales curriculum that gives people from diverse and non-traditional backgrounds, like myself, an opportunity to break into tech. I had never been a part of an educational program that provided me with the support and community built upon racial diversity and equality! What‚Äôs more, there is no upfront cost and so that eliminated any worry of financial strain throughout the program.

I am in my last two weeks in the program, and preparing to be interviewed by leading tech companies that have also partnered with the program.

,,careercenter_edmonds,,,,,"Research similar roles (or at least position levels) at other local hospitals in your area. The size of the hospital shouldn't determine your value when you're negotiating salary. You could try looking at Payscale and Glassdoor to see whether they have some numbers that could help you ballpark what others in similar positions are making. Put out a well-researched number that you are happy with, and if you are the right match for the job, they will negotiate with you moving forward. Keep in mind that they may not be able to match what you would like, and they could counter - have a base number in the back of your mind so you know how far you're willing to negotiate in case this comes up. If they aren't able to offer the salary you're looking for, consider whether you'd also be willing to make up the difference in other areas - time off, retirement, healthcare benefits, etc."

What is Bachelor of Arts in Communication?,hhz7j0,chieminanami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/hhz7j0/what_is_bachelor_of_arts_in_communication/,4,5,1593434774.0,
,,zevathorn75,,,,,"I have a communication BA with a specialty in PR (certificate.) I decide PR wasn‚Äôt for me during my internship though. I suppose this degree could bring you financial stability. It is very versatile, meaning that it‚Äôs too general to ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù a high paying job so it is up to you with your connections and drive to make that happen. By this I mean, nurses go into nursing, accountants, accounting... where comm is pretty ambiguous. I personally work for a non-profit. I love my job but sometimes wish I would have studied something more specific because it is not financially lucrative. I was told it can do soo many things with it but have learned that most I would need more accreditation‚Äôs to do something else. This is only my experience l don‚Äôt want to dissuade you from it, just worth thinking about."
,,anonymous_chaos_,,,,,"A lot of jobs in the communications field involves acting as an intermediary between parties. So for example, an event planner would work between the event space and the interested parties to figure out details. A human resources representative would work as a mediator between companies and their employees. An alumni specialist would communicate between a university and their alumni. Communication is a very diverse area and it can easily be tailored and specialized, either while earning a bachelors, or through a masters."
,,starry__nights,,,,,"I think you should be thinking about why you‚Äôre considering doing a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. The course can differ from uni to uni so look up the course guides. Think about what jobs you might be interested in. Read job descriptions of jobs that want applicants who have done that course. Do personality and career tests. Try different things, try free communications courses that are alone to get a taste of what it‚Äôs like. Communications majors can work in jobs that have writing/media/photography/film related tasks. Maybe think about marketing/social media/UX writing/user interface design careers. Look at the salaries of those jobs.

Best of luck"
,,mipan_Philippines,,,,,"We're on the same seat! I'm also 17 and just graduated senior high school. I saw BA Communication as a complex course, based on what I searched and graduates reviews. But from the said reviews, it is rarely high paying unless you have the connections, either graduated in universities that are center for excellence given by CHED or you are destined to be in the booming media outlets in the Philippines. Most of the graduates either become tutor, English professor or work in BPO (not belittling). But as I have said, this is a complex course, we just need to explore.  Of course we are worried about the future, but what we need to worry right now is how we can gain specific skills that will make us different from other candidates, as this world is full of competition. Honestly, I'm still undecided right now, wether to take BS IT or a Communications degree. Of course the demand in programming related courses are booming in terms of salary pay. But the thing is, will I survive? Learning the fundamentals of coding languages and such. Will I be happy? That I'm just doing this for the money? I'm giving second thoughts actually as I have no any single idea about the course (IT). But I suppose, you are decided right now. Hope you go well with the course you are pursuing right now. Let's not be torn on what we see on social media. What we need to do right now is to pick a skill, aside from what the course is teaching you and put an effort to it. More of like a passion but will benefit you in the future. Build networks and explore. Best of luck mate."
,,chieminanami,,,,,"Hey, We're the same! BSIT and Communications are also my two choices right now, and I'm still 50/50 about this because just like you, I'm having my doubts. The reason why I'm considering BSIT is also because of the money, I know I mentioned in my post that I didn't enjoy it but lately, I'm having second thoughts about Communications because I only considered it when I didn't know what course to take and I don't really know what I'm going to do with it. I'm familiar with IT because I took an ICT strand in Senior High but I recently realized that I never actually took the course seriously. So I'm trying to learn programming again by myself and see if I can handle it and be willing to try BSIT despite saying in the past that I will never take an IT related course again. It sucks that I don't really have a passion, I just want to go to college so that I can graduate and get a decent job in the future. It's been a month but I'm still undecided just like you. Anyways, Thank you!. It's comforting to know that I'm not alone. I hope that you also find your passion and I hope that we both figure out the course that we want to take. Fingers crossed! :)"

Hey, thanks! I¬¥ve looked him up - his career path seems amazing! What¬¥s your experience in advertising? Do you have the freedom to come up with your own ideas, be creative? Does it pay well if you don¬¥t mind me asking (:"
,,,,,,,"My experience has been really good. Started off as a digital strategist at BBH, so many briefs was working with the creative teams to come up with digital/social ideas that supported a TV campaign. 

I've since moved to working as a brand strategist which means you work with the creative teams to create the brief and shape the thinking. Lots of workshops, brain storming, arguing to get to better work. I love it and it pays well later in your career.

The short spiel to all this is the brand of a company creates intangible value. It's what helps create difference and distinction between company x, y and z. So clients look to agencies to come up with content and campaigns to do that because a) they don't have the resource and talent to do that and b) they lack the time.

There is a great podcast called Real Famous where celebrated advertisers tell their story of how they got to where they are. Have a listen to some of those - Icaro Doria would be a good place to start as he's a creative guy who started out in Brazil and ended up being top dog at many of the NY agencies. Feel free to ask anything else :)"
,,,,,,,"That sounds really interesting. It¬¥s good that you like your career, it¬¥s not too common nowadays :) 

Have you studied marketing? I¬¥ve seen that many people do a BA in Graphic Design and a MA in marketing, or a double major, which also sounds interesting. 

I¬¥ll definitely check them out, thank you! Second question: Would you say that it¬¥s a lot of creative work (coming up with ideas for ad campaigns) or mainly analytical (analysing what¬¥s needed, the demand, calculating how much the campaigns will cost, what would be most profitable)?"
,,,,,,,"I did study marketing, but I don't think a marketing degree is necessary to get into advertising. A degree is less relevant these days tbh, people care more about if you're interesting as a person and have experiences that offer a different perspective on things.

On Q2 it depends on the agency and role. You can split agencies into two camps; creative (comes up with the campaigns) and media (recommends how best to distribute the campaigns). So for me (creative) it's part analytical because you need to understand the competition, culture and the brand to identify new opportunities and to write briefs. The things you mention would sit more with a media agency."

The only bit that really matters in all this is the first sentence.  I assume this means that the job doesn't particularly fulfill you.  If I've got that wrong and in fact you like it, I really wouldn't let self-defeating thoughts like ""I'm a fraud"" and ""I don't deserve this"" get in your way.

(I would rather die to live without passion.). Bc of my major (I majored Econ and minored math), I also could become a banker or financial worker (actually, lots of ppl around me are banker, the finance position is also relatively easy to find). I wanna do something may have positive impact to the world, but so many ppl could do better bc of the majors that they declared at first.

Then a mutual contact gave my current boss my number and he started recruiting me. I guess being wanted is nice. Honestly, I think it helps to actually say all of this. I feel better that I‚Äôm not the only one who feels like this."
,,,,,,,"This may be getting deeper than anyone wants to go, but as I have read these comments and further thought about this I have come to this, I started in my current career path as a means to have income. The first few years were hard financially, being broke and in debt colored my object as I moved up the ladder. I‚Äôve been chasing a certain income level in hopes of getting my family financially secure. I‚Äôve succeeded. We aren‚Äôt rich, but I make a good living. We have the things we need and most of what we want within reason. We also have some savings. It feels like for years I‚Äôve been on a mission with nothing but money leading the way. Not out of greed, but out of what I felt was necessity. It is like now that I am not chasing something I have time to think about whether or not I enjoy what I do. The weird thing is it is just kinda like beige, I don‚Äôt hate it, but I don‚Äôt love it. It is just neutral. As I‚Äôm typing this I am realizing that maybe my passion shouldn‚Äôt be linked to my source of income. I am beginning to believe we have been fed a lie that says our career should be our passion or our passion should be our career. The two can be independent. I am ok with my career not being my life‚Äôs passion."

,,thejezzajc,,,,,"There are a few things here.  First of all, you don't have to accept a ""beige"" career.  That was exactly the expression [one of the guests on my podcast](https://changeworklife.com/leaving-a-beige-career-and-becoming-a-tv-sensation/) used to describe his old job (he's now a successful comedy writer and actor).

Next, you job doesn't have to be your ""passion"".  A classic example is Steve Jobs.  His ""passion"" was yoga (I think...).  But he enjoyed helping people in the IT space.  So yes it's worth aiming for being passionate/enjoying what you do but your job doesn't have to be your passion.

In terms of working out sort of career might be right for you, I'd look at this from the perspective of (1) what you enjoy doing and are good at; and (2) the lifestyle that you want you career to support, in terms of pay, hours, commute, etc.

I would target people who are earlier in their career (night have more time and empathy for your situation) and those later in their career for more long term perspective. To help find these people, I would try to join a local professional group for your field of study which will help build connections. Also, I did a lot of cold notes on LinkedIn to people I thought make me helpful (ie phone or coffee chat about career advice). People are more willing to help than you think.

Reach out to individuals with the career trajectories you idealize, and ask to meet them for 15 minutes to chat about their career path. Your alumni will be most likely to engage, and often people are very flattered to receive those requests for chats! People love to talk about themselves, so you often won't need to talk that much. Have questions ready, be genuinely interested, don't expect them to refer you to a job each time, and be very clear about your interests."

Career Coach here. It is completely fine to approach a mentor even if you do not know which direction you want to go in. Career Coaches can assist you in discovering the path most suited for you based on your interests and skills.

In my practice, I use a series of tests coupled with interactions to guide my mentees. After a direction has been discovered, I focus on constructing a plan and finding opportunities in order to achieve the end goal. Based on several factors such as financial constraints, needs and inclinations of my clients, I set short term targets and help my mentees work towards achieving them.

9:36 AM (2 hours ago)**üì∑****üì∑**to meüì∑Good Morning,  
¬† Thanks for your interest in the job. Cynthia forwarded your information to me. I owe you a quick background on me. I hold a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the Pratt Institute in New York. I have 20+ years of construction & home designs. I am one of those that likes to know what is next if at all possible. Basically, I like the control if I can with my career. I do not play games or like wasting time. I have recently been moved to our Boston, MA branch area and starting my position as Senior Program Manager. I presently live in Illinois with my wife and 2 kids.¬† My wife is starting a new job with the tax office so she'll be moving ahead of me with our 2 kids.  
Right now, I need someone on the ground in Boston, MA to run basic errands for me while I'm away in Illinois. I need someone who is mobile and with knowledge of the city. The work is part-time and home-based so that means you can complete the job duties from your place of residence. Our primary mode of correspondence will be via email and sometimes text messaging. I'll send you instructions when necessary on errands to run and how to carry them out. Cynthia my HR manager will mail out a check for $650 to you every week as your wage and sometimes more than that depending on the errands you're attending to that week. If the work terms are fine with you, get back to me with your direct phone number for further communications. Also, send your current address with apt number to receive payments and other mails. I'll fly out of Chicago by 25th of July so I look forward to meeting in person too.  
Get back to me soon with address and phone number and we can start next week. I will be in touch with the necessary employment documents for you to fill out and other details regarding your weekly payments.  
Regards  
Kilian Wheatley

,,alyssaisrad93,,,,,"I was in a very similar position to you a few years ago, except I originally got a degree in Political Science and spent a year studying and taking the LSAT for law school. A week before I was supposed to start I decided I didn't want to be a lawyer and didn't go. 

I then re-enrolled in undergrad for a journalism degree because I've always enjoyed media and writing, but like you I didn't want to become an actual journalist. After a semester I changed my major to Public Relations with a minor in Digital Marketing because I also didn't want to write for a publication and enjoyed it SO much more.

I always thought PR was just talking to the media and writing press releases, but it's a lot more. Social media, blogging, internal communications, etc. PR has actually started to take over traditional journalism roles as well, and you can apply it to many different areas.

I just graduated in December, so with the world the way it is I haven't been hired yet, but it opens so many more doors than journalism, but you still get to learn about all the things that originally interested you about it in the first place. Definitely look into it and let me know if you have any questions!"
,,whistleblower227,,,,,"I appreciate your reply! The prolonged distressed job market is definitely a source of anxiety.

Burnout Advice,gnkoe6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/gnkoe6/burnout_advice/,3,15,1590013733.0,
,,matt_moneytalk,,,,,"This sounds like a horrible experience. Burn out is real and sounds like there is no way to work at this company due to boundary issues from the owner. I'd try to find a new job asap that doesn't require so much overtime. If you were working as a high level manager in your mid-twenties you're obviously really talented. I'd take a step back, assess your skills and abilities and use this opportunity to find a better role. Life is too short to be miserable."
,,,,,,,"Me me me! My job is very similar, I am nearly always on call, expected to work 60-65 hour weeks ‚Äúto make the numbers we did last year‚Äù and with COVID everything has been a shit show. I was even called in to do someone else‚Äôs job temporarily on top of mine.

I‚Äôve been slowly spiraling into burnout, but this takes the cake. Also we are ‚Äúnot allowed‚Äù to take vacation during the summer months. 

In my little free time I‚Äôve been going to therapy, painting, and doing other hobbies piddling around, and for the first time in my life I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúmaybe I am not someone who enjoys a busy career‚Äù.

Now all I can think about is selling all my shit and working 25-30 hours a week."
,,PiemanMk2,,,,,"First of all, really sorry you've been going through this. I had a very similar experience in the last couple of years.

I was a Director level person in a media agency, quite senior but not quite the executive leadership team. I was basically the go-to person for a lot of complex and challenging work because i had built a strong track record where I was trusted with that sort of thing. But that became a poison chalice as I was seen as so trustworthy that I ended up feeling like I was left on my own without support from my leaders, despite running big valuable projects. I went through a year where I was working, I think a solid average of 60 hours a week for the best part of a year. Long story short, I got so angry, frustrated, and miserable that I totally burned out and had a mental breakdown. I was signed off for stress, put on medication. I went back to work because I didn't want to be seen as weak, I guess. Nothing really changed and I promptly had another breakdown even worse than the first. I had to take more time off, up medication dosage, and go see a therapist. 

I say all this not as some weird flex or whatever, but just to say that I have been more or less exactly where you are now. I've been at that low point of feeling ashamed of collapsing under the strain, and also enraged that it was something as bullshit as my job in *marketing* of all things that put me there. 

And now, plot twist. I'm actually still at that same company, working with many of the same people, but I've never been happier in my work career. How I got there is a combination of the aforementioned medication and therapy, which has helped me disassociate my sense of self worth from my work performance to an extent, getting a dog, focusing more on what I want and need from my career and my life, trying to rein in my comparisons of myself to others and their successes/journeys and a bunch of other stuff. I'd be happy to discuss with you and just generally chat if that would help, but in terms of basic immediate things you can do, I would suggest:

1. Have a serious think about why you are working. This sounds insane, but what actually do you work *for*? Is it because you want a Ferrari? Or is it because you want to one day have the freedom to, I don't know, be a carpenter?
2. What is/would be the best path to that goal? Does it include this current job or not?
3. Tell your company in no uncertain terms your conditions for continuing to work there. I don't mean in the dancing around the subject political language we usually deploy in career conversation. I mean in the high stakes, life or death terms of a hostage negotiation. Because this is now a matter of life and death. A lot of people end up contemplating and even committing suicide over this sort of thing, I know I thought about it. It sounds like from other comments you've made that the owner of this company takes you for granted and expects you to drop everything, even after telling him you're struggling, because of ""exceptional circumstances"". Fuck that. He's exploiting you, sooner you see that the better. Demand a significant equity stake in the business (10-20%) if he wants you to keep being his ""right hand."" If the company's success is your own, great. If you get paid the same salary as some other asshole regardless, then why work more than contracted to? ""Growing"" company means ""small and largely irrelevant."" Sorry to be brutal, but you aren't the right hand of Jeff Bezos. This person has virtually no leverage over you in the real world.
4. It's up to them if they facilitate some or all of those requirements or not. Be prepared to walk away immediately if they don't.
5. To that end, speak to recruiters *now*. Gloss up your CV and experience and get another job lined up ASAP

I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to DM me if you prefer."
,,maryfox20,,,,,"I recommend reading (or listening to) Essentialism. Everytime I read it, I remember that we always have choice ‚Äî¬†even when expectations are high. I've probably listened to it / read it like 6 or 7 times over the past few years.

The thing about setting boundaries is that you never know what will happen until you do it. The worst case scenario is that you'll be fired. But the reality is that you'll probably get better at prioritizing, communicating trade-offs, seeing what happens when you say ""I can't do that right now unless I prioritize it over this other work."" 

Also, maybe consider working with a coach who can help you think through your word choices when you communicate boundaries. They may also be able to help you think through which work is a real prioritiy, and which isn't. 

Good luck!"
,,TheMonarchOfTheSea,,,,,"Oh my god yes.  Had similar experience but working retail so not as much responsibility but I was doing more hours at my job to cover for a department manager.  I don't usually work crazy hours, like usually 20-30, but this job had me doing 40-45 because of all the overtime. 

Cherry on top is that when the manager came back from leave she started criticizing small nitpicky things about my work instead of thanking me for covering for her for several months.  And the people in my old department see me as lazy because I don't help them out (when I already have a ton of stuff on my plate).  

And now I am expected to put my life at risk for an extra $2.  I had many moments of burnout and stress doing that job (with barely any extra pay) but I kept working at it and casually pursuing hobbies on the side but not being that serious about finding a new job.  

However, a few months ago, I got symptoms and they haven't gone away yet so now I'm in a state of EI-supported limbo deciding what my next move will be when I get better.  And I've decided that no matter what I do, I'm quitting and finding something else.  I hated this job but I never did anything about it and covid-19 gave me that push I needed.  

I might switch to something like starbucks which might not be that much of an improvement but better benefits, or something really part time and do remote work on the side.  However, that would at least be better than doing long weeks of work and not being appreciated and getting severe anxiety and sleep issues as a consequence.

This voice in the back of my mind says it's stupid to quit my job right now but I have lots of savings and if I don't make a move at some point I'm going to still be at that stupid store when I'm 40 so..."
,,Sazzybee,,,,,"Hate to say it, lost my job due to Covid, and 4 weeks later, I felt back to my old normal self, I was burnt out too, I literally couldn't feel anything anymore due to a toxic workplace.

It just sucks because the reality of my job is that I‚Äôm sort of at their beck and call and that‚Äôs where my value has really been. I actually decided to leave on burnout when I said ‚ÄúI need X, Y, Z‚Äù with regards to boundaries and the owner‚Äôs reply was ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do that right now because of these exceptional times‚Äù.

How easy is it to get an apprenticeship as an electrician? Will this virus make it harder to do this career change?,gkz9n1,missmamsir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/gkz9n1/how_easy_is_it_to_get_an_apprenticeship_as_an/,5,5,1589652567.0,
,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,"Best thing to do is start right away. Do you have savings? Where do you live? I find it hard to believe you cannot find a job at 37 with a degree in graphic design? Do you have an associate's or a bachelor's? What are some reasons you're getting turned down? You might want to look into going back to school for something related to graphic design. But if you're unable to move or commute to a big city with graphic design jobs, and you're dead set on becoming an electrician, you have to start by either securing a apprenticeship, or going to school. There's typically 4 years of theory classes, and 4 years of labor, then you become a journeyman. Start taking the first year of classes immediately if this is what you're going to do. Regardless of whether you've got a 1st year apprenticeship job or not. You'll thank yourself when you're in your 4th year of labor & you dont have to go home and do schoolwork 2 days a week. There's online schools and there's typically programs set up at community colleges. Your state's adult ed/ continuing education board will have them as well, in addition to the IEC and your local electrical union. The union is the holy grail, because they put you through school for free, and you typically reach great pay after putting in a couple years as an apprentice. The IEC is like a union, but you're basically paying them 2500 a year to keep you working and teach you the trade. Next best would be going through the community college system, which is usually pricey. Next best would be going through the adult education system, but they typically require that you secure employment as a 1st year apprentice BEFORE you enroll. Next best would be a trade school, which is usually a 1 year intensive program that'll cost you between 15 & 30 grand but it'll knock out all schooling requirements in 1 year. Finally, the online courses. They're garbage but they're cheap and easy. Not the best education and hiring managers know that, but they'll get you through and spit you out an electrician in 4 years. Good luck."
,,kombatk,,,,,"Many commercial electrical companies offer paid apprenticeship programs. When complete, you automatically have your journeyman, if the program is licensed in your state. There is a classroom portion and tests but you‚Äôre working while doing it. It‚Äôs estimated that 85% of the current trade workforce will be retired by 2035. As someone who works very closely with graphic designers, I‚Äôm telling you if you‚Äôre in a small or mid-size city, you‚Äôll make more money as an electrician. Unless you‚Äôre very talented or are in a large city, you won‚Äôt make as much as a designer. The market is saturated and there are too many people out there to do whatever is needed for less or freelance. However, this is my experience from managing a team of designers and seeing where they are now and I‚Äôm currently working at a construction company. My dad was an electrician. There is money to be made if you‚Äôre smart and show up every day."
,,slant__i,,,,,"Get a job doing construction and use that to network for electrical contractors that are hiring.  Also all the advice mentioned above about apprenticeship/school to become electrical trainee.

If you can already prove you have what it takes to hold down a job in construction(labor work likely), you are much less of a gamble to hire.  Show a willingness for all aspects of the job, especially things like digging and sweeping at first.  I‚Äôm not sure what the current market looks like, but I know most commercial solar hires local labor through recruiters like temp agencies.  Not a bad place to start out, I met quite a few electricians and people who used those hours to count toward the journeyman test. The pay is generally pretty low compared to other electrical work, but if you get in with a good company they will take care of you(few and far between ime).

I‚Äôve heard some trying to get in for months even up to years.  Easiest way is to find an electrical contractor that is willing to give you a shot.  Most probably won‚Äôt care about any degree, as it‚Äôs unrelated to what they will be hiring you for.  Even trade schools aren‚Äôt taken all that serious compared to real experience.  Learn the tools you‚Äôll need and slowly start buying the most essential."
,,missmamsir,,,,,"I have a bachelors and and Associates, one in media and the other in Visual Communications. Before that I tried to go to another in Florida for Art, but couldn't concentrate there and didn't finish. After that I did community college for basic courses and then went to those other colleges to focus on the art programs. I'm mostly self taught and already knew most of the programs. Coding is a bitch though, more and more designers need to know how to, and I've tried teaching myself and doing courses, but it's just not something I can get as hard as I try. 

For a year now while unemployed I've lived by a train in walking distance into Chicago, applying to all the graphic design jobs I'm capable of on a daily basis with no luck. And my somewhat girlfriend that's living with me wants to BUY a house up north close to her job and where homes are cheaper, and I'm just here like... yeah I don't know if that's really going to work for me and my situation on many levels. 

After all the schooling I've done... I just can't. I've practically been in school all my life. I need the quickest and cheapest option for getting started. So that's the IEC? I don't know if it's possible to start right away with this virus going on though. I have ""some"" savings and atm splitting rent for the time being."
,,formerlydeaddd,,,,,"Look up the IEC in your state. Ours has suspended enrollment but, our state is partially opening soon and i assume they'll be enrolling again soon. You'll need to pay them 2500 & they'll get you a job and you'll start night classes, twice a week, 2 hours each day they're held. It'll be a lot of algebra, & best practices. They'll get you your OSHA and first aid training and everything you need. But it's not going to be well paid your first couple years. Your first year might be 15 an hour with intermittent layoffs. Your second year might be 17.50. Third year maybe 20 if you're lucky. Fourth year 21 maybe. Once you journey out in your fourth or 5th year, pass your journeyman test, you should receive a good raise if you've been at the same company for a while. At least 24-25 an hour. Once you're a journeyman for a year or so you can request journeyman wages, which if Google is correct, you should hit close to 60k in Illinois, especially in a metro, BEFORE overtime.  

But i can't stress enough how you shouljd be able to get a job with your decorated education background.  There's no doubt in my mind that if you spent the same 2500 you're going to pay the IEC, on a good personal recruiting agent, you'll find a job at least paying 20 an hour with your degree. Even if it's a temp job... you can make PowerPoint presentations for 20 an hour man.

Oh, alternatively, you can take online classes and pay the IEC something like $700 a year to be a member, and they'll give you access to their apprenticeship job pool."

,,chrissycm,,,,,"Yes and no...

... for money? No, you are likely to lose more wasting time. If you do, go community college. But you might be better off delaying a year or two to work and explore.

... for the value of learning and social integration and learning. Yes, definitely.   You learn a lot in college that has nothing to do with the classes. (Or the parties, which I have zero experience in even having gone to a ""party"" college.)  The social system of college will be repeated in jobs, the connections you make often come back, etc. Etc. Etc.  I find my college education to be worth it in almost every way except finacial."
,,slant__i,,,,,"Community college is a good place to explore different fields without investing a ton of time and money into one focus.  If you decide to change majors after 2 years it will be much more financially practical than a regular 4 year.

If school doesn‚Äôt interest you then find an apprenticeship that will pay you to work and learn a trade.  If you do that for 5 years and decide to go back to school, you will hopefully be in a good place financially(assuming you don‚Äôt blow it and take on a bunch of debt) as well as good work experience to help guide what you want to do for a career.

The only real risk in going to college is that you take on a bunch of debt to get a degree in something you can‚Äôt use to make money.  Or you find out you hate working in that field after investing 4+ years and thousands of dollars.  I know some say things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about the money‚Äù when deciding a major, but I think it‚Äôs a foolish thing to do financially.  At some point you will have to repay the loans, and if the degree doesn‚Äôt put you in a much better position to earn money... well hopefully you have rich parents."
,,,,,,,Is there any particular subject you‚Äôre interested in? Like maybe bio or computer or something in humanities? I didnt kno what i wanted to do either when I entered college but i knew i liked healthcare and health professions have mostly the same basics so it was super easy to switch. (I switched like 3 times haha) it also depends on how far you want to go. Some jobs require higher degrees (bachelors and up) and other jobs just require a certification or associates
,,kentksu97,,,,,"Community college is good for exploring what you want to do. I would also look up your local 4 year college policies on credits though, because I learned some colleges charge you the out of state rate once you reach a certain amount of credits. This is due to the colleges just wanting you to get a 4 year degree and getting out. I wish the US college system would be more about learning and continuing higher education than getting your degree and pushing you out. Lifelong learners exist."
,,BigMac197,,,,,"That's a tough one. Really it depends on who you are as a person and your goals. I'd say a college degree is only good for a few reasons: 1) Some careers demand it, i.e. doctor, lawyer etc. 2) Often times job applicants without degrees get overlooked by those with degrees, so a degree helps with getting your foot in the door (but remember experience > degree, so this isn't always the case). and 3) College is amazing to meet people, get out of your comfort zone, and live independently. 

Those are some things to consider. Ultimately, if you can get a degree without it putting yourself into a lot of debt, I think its worth it. Not so much for the education, but for the experience that living on your own in a new place can give you."

,,eerickson246,,,,,I‚Äôm interested in psychology and maybe art history. I have my associates in liberal arts from a community college. I‚Äôve just been indecisive on what I want to do for about 3 years now. I work at a high end retail store right now and I enjoy it but it‚Äôs not something I envision myself doing long term. I feel like the only way to get a better paid job is finishing my bachelors.
,,eerickson246,,,,,Yeah I've been indecisive for years after getting my associates with what I want to do for my bachelors. I'm 24 years old and I feel like time is ticking for me to get my shit together lol
,,chrissycm,,,,,"I would throw that out the window, personally. 

Many, many jobs just want to see a degree. It doesn't matter if it is ""in"" the industry for many. 

If you specifically really want to work for the subject you studied- then you can fight for it. The stereotypes are from so many people who expect to be handed it, or that the degree will result in a job in that industry, and that isnt accurate. Some degrees don't get your foot in the door even if it gets you the education. If you want one of those, go for very specific jobs like pharmacy. Liberal arts degrees can be applied... liberally. My example for this is my husband. Got his masters in Anthropology. Loves it. He has used that degree very directly (digs in romania) and for things that are a stretch (teaching high school chemistry).  The ones he has to fight for to get the most are the most directly his degree. He uses connections he has built, skills he has learned, experiences he's had... the easy ones are usually the ones that don't seem to relate. (Like teaching high school)... but you will never see him say the fighting isn't worth the fight.... and no matter what he does, he breathes Anthropology. Even in part time just-money jobs he has taken like working for a moving company ... he used his skills to bridge communication gaps, find excitement in his day, or teach someone something new. He cannot put it down because he is passionate.  He has had many colleges who ""dropped out"" of the Anthropology scene because they liked learning, but they didn't want to fight. Most are happy in totally tangential positions, that loosely use their education. ... also... he didnt have that passion going into school, he learned it through studying... and many of his classmates didn't.  That was okay too."
,,ThatProfessor3301,,,,,"Art history is not something that will lead to a paying job. My neighbor has a PhD in art history. Lucky for her she has a husband who is an architect and a rich dad. Unless that‚Äôs your deal, do something more practical. Have you considered applied psychology: education, business, social work..."
,,slant__i,,,,,"It depends on the field you want to go into.  Want to become an electrical engineer?  Probably not possible without at the very least an engineering degree, likely you will need electrical engineering or enough relevant work experience to prove your competence, which will be basically impossible to get without an electrical engineering degree.  Same with chemist and probably all STEM majors.  There is probably a lot more wiggle room if you have a STEM degree than compared to an art major.  

Not to downplay art degrees, but personally I‚Äôm not familiar with a whole lot of doors that it will open for you in the business world.  It‚Äôs probably better than no degree but not always, some jobs want people easy to train and an unrelated degree can make you overqualified for entry level positions.  Also, some majors like psychology aren‚Äôt really that beneficial in finding a job unless you go to the doctorate level.  Ive has friends with masters in psych making less than they would have if they just spent the same amount of time working.  

So it all depends on what your goal is.  Chances are you have a few of them, and some of them may be in direct competition.  For example, make a lot of money and enjoy life can be two coinciding goals that also compete for the same time and energy.  It‚Äôs up to you to prioritize and choose which goals are going to take precedence over another.  So doing something you love and doing something that earns a good wage and has a good career outlook might be opposing goals to a degree, but there is likely a happy balance once you decide what‚Äôs more important to you.

So you mention art and psychology as your interests.  I‚Äôll focus on psychology as an example just because I‚Äôm more familiar with that field.  It‚Äôs good to be passionate about what you‚Äôre doing, but ultimately you need to hone your interests into skills that are applicable to the current job market.  So in the field of psychology that looks like counselors, social workers, therapist, psychologist, and PhD researchers.  Probably more if you decide to specialize, but you‚Äôll probably be a form of one.  Most these jobs have certification or licensing processes in order to legally work.  So having an art degree or even an unrelated STEM degree will not help, you will still have to go back and take the required classes in order to work in the field.


TLDR: it depends on what you want to do, but likely you‚Äôll need to narrow your focus to really answer that question.  Rather than just thinking of what general major you want to study, start thinking about what sort of job you‚Äôd like to work, and be specific.   Start looking into all the different requirements for those jobs.  Talk to people currently working in the field, ask them about their background and anything that‚Äôs help.  The whole ‚Äúyou need to go to college to get a good job‚Äù is a complete lie.  There are plenty without degrees making great money and plenty with degrees with nothing but debt.  It all depends on your specific goals, and if you‚Äôre not sure what those are it‚Äôs time to start."
,,,,,,,"Im not too familiar with jobs outside of healthcare but for art history, i would assume that would lead to a teaching position. Psychology is more versatile. Could probably go into business, jobs relating to mental health, really anything that requires dealing with people. Many people major in psych and go the doctorate route as well. If you‚Äôre close to finishing your bachelor‚Äôs, finish it. If you haven‚Äôt started, you can look into entry level jobs that you might be interested in? I became interested in optometry after working as an optometric assistant"

,,blueopera,,,,,"Did you applied to a PhD program that is funded?  A funded program is a bit more palatable than one that would require a significant investment of resources or student loans.

It doesn't sound like you're very excited about the path within academia. Academia can be very competitive, in the sense that it's not laid back until you get tenure. So you're looking at 4+ years to muddle through the degree, then working hard teaching and getting research published for about 7 years or so until you make tenure. Even then, you need to continue to apply for grants to fund your research. I'm sure it's possible, but it's not the kind of field that typically has a ton of work/life balance that would give you a lot of time to pursue your baking ""hobby"" (I use quotes because work demands would probably restrict you from making it more than a hobby). Not to mention advising graduate students and reading through dissertation drafts.

If I do get an acceptance with full funding, there's a higher chance I'll take the academia path. But imagine I get rejected-- do I continue working at my current job and try again next year?

There are other reasons such as clashing with family (parents), the anxiety of getting a huge loan to start a business (I imagine this is very normal to anyone starting a business for the first time), and other private reasons that's making me antsy."

I know at a lot of colleges there are programs to help with setting up a resume and interviewing. I think there is also often stuff through government services. Having someone trained at that to go through your history and help you clean that up could be the difference between an entry level job and a career you really like. So I would take the time to go look through that. 

If that doesn't  help, maybe look into some more minor managing jobs to get back into the industry and then move on from there? But ai think that is selling yourself short."
,,paz_vegas,,,,,"Sounds like you're interested in the HR space and have a diverse and rich range of job / career experience under your belt.  That is awesome and something to be extremely proud of! In terms of taking the next step into the HR field, have you thought about finding short courses (instead of a full blown degree) to explore which aspect of HR you're particularly interested in? 

Tbh degrees are expensive and a huge commitment especially if you don't know what you plan to do with it, you could be degree qualified and without a job/career in it. It's never to late to go back to study, but you have to be clear about what you're doing it for and work your network to find opportunities.

I got my degree in Accounting and ended up quitting my career because in the working world, it just wasn't for me but I don't see it as a waste of time, just a learning and feedback opportunity. But now I still have to pay back the debt. 

I'd recommend reaching out to people who are in the industry or type of job you're interested in and talking to them. That would give you a better sense of whether you would like to commit to study or find other work that interests you.

You're not behind in life, you're just on your own path.

Perhaps try volunteering and see if you can find something you'd like. Taking up new hobbies or starting a side hustle could be some options. It's great that you've identified you like solving problems and helping people live their lives easier. I would suggest beginning with taking personality tests and seeing what careers suit the personality type that is assigned to you. You don't have to believe in the results but it's a good way to start in my opinion."
,,martin1811,,,,,"Just go travelling.  I‚Äôm sure you will find something !!! There is a lot more to see outside your comfort zone than you might think. Or if that is not an option, do something out of ordinary- learn a new language , take a dancing class .. whatever it is , it will open your mind to new possibilities you have never imagined and you will eventually find what you have always wanted to do."

,,thejezzajc,,,,,"There are so many ways you can solve problems and make people happier or make things easier for people. 

Start by getting a bit more specific about what you'd like to do. 

This podcast interview I did with a career coach might help:

,,Imaginary_Willow,,,,,"The idea of making life easier for others is cool, and seems related to program management. I'm thinking of a role where you develop more efficient processes for a team, or use technology (like a CRM) to make day to day tasks easier (sales ops).

To the best of my knowledge, the same fields that make people smile/happy are also the ones where you have to deal with challenging people.  So unfortunately that one cuts both ways. 

I enjoy Reid Hoffman's Startup Of You on thinking about careers:  [https://www.thestartupofyou.com/](https://www.thestartupofyou.com/). 

Good luck to you!"
,,,,,,,"I'm very sorry to hear that :/ it sounds you carry a lot of pressured. Maybe instead of focusing on your position/job/career, you need to focus on yourself. Instead of making people happy, try to make yourself happy because you are people too!  Like you said, you enjoy solving people's problem, you should enjoy solving your own problem!

You don't have to learn something new because learning something new when inside you is not happy, it will be hard to enjoy them. Just try to really listen to yourself. Don't multitask, like if you eat, just eat not eating and watching at the same time. I think once you really appreciate these small things, you can focus on the bigger side. Good luck!"
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"Fair point. I've started working on comparing myself to others less often, so that has helped with the feeling of being behind... Although seeing younger colleagues in the same position or higher than mine sometimes hurts still.

I tried a volunteer opportunity, and although it does feel nice, it's not leading to a career. I had looked at a bunch of opportunities, but it was actually harder than I thought to find something that I'd enjoy doing... I have started new hobbies as well, and they've been really enjoyable, but haven't really helped my professional life.

I actually did a few of these tests! And if I remember the results, they usually pointed to the types of personalities with a ""helper"" trait, so I guess they were pretty spot on...! The types of jobs I'm starting to identify in that area are jobs in the hospitality industry, in entertainment (like in theme parks), or something like a personal/executive assistant. Out of these, the latter is the type that is closer to what I do now and would probably be the easiest to get into. However, after researching it a bit, I'm afraid I would be trapped at a single level and not having much room to grow or evolve..."
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"I do try to travel as often as I can for vacation, but being married sort of curtails what I can do outside of that! I have also started new hobbies - I started skateboarding and doing calligraphy this year - and although it has been awesome on a personal level, it hasn't really helped me figure things out professionally...

I've talked to an adviser who suggested thinking of what I would do if I had no limitations (in terms of skills, income, experience, etc.). I came up with some things, but when I put them in a realistic context, I'm not sure I have a path to any of them..."
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"Enough to be living ok, but at my age and education level, I probably should be making more."
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"Thanks for the link, that was very interesting!

I've actually done a list of the things I want in my career/job before, and I would say that my current job does fit a number of them. However, most of the items that I managed to come up with, and that are fulfilled at my job, are related to the setting and work conditions (hours, commute, benefits, things like that) and not to the specific of the job/career...

I mentioned in another comment that I also tried to list the type of careers I'd be interested in if I had no limitations (in terms of income, experience, skills, etc.), but after trying to see a realistic path to them, they didn't really seem attainable. I'm trying to work my way down from them (because they probably are idealistic) to jobs that have the same characteristics which are appealing to me, but that's not very effective so far..."
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"You're right, it does work in the context of program management. I think the main problem might be that I struggle to find the tasks that I enjoy doing, and thus the tasks that I'd enjoy doing to make things easier for people. I actually just applied for a job where some of the responsibilities would be related to that (it also includes other less interesting stuff, but I can't find the perfect fit, or at least not right away). We'll see how that goes...

I'll look up that book, thanks for the recommendation.

And thank you!"
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"That's a very wholesome outlook, thank you. :)"
,,LawrenceHugh70,,,,,"Cool. What‚Äôs your education level and where did you go to school? And how much money?

You say you feel behind because you started late and made lateral moves, so if you feel like you should be making more money I don‚Äôt think switching things up again is going to be the ticket."
,,MutedCeiling,,,,,"I have a master's degree but I don't really feel like using actual numbers. Of course, like everyone else, I'd like to make more money. However, I would absolutely prioritize doing something I enjoy over more money.

So money is not the issue or what I'm looking for."

,,HardenedLicorice,,,,,"What qualifies as a 'big fuck-up' to you? Everybody makes mistakes. Your train of thought seems to be ""Welp, I just fucked up - better quit right away."" A healthy response to a mistake would be to pick yourself up and improve. It's only natural that your head is affected in a negative way when you jump from failure to failure. Own your mistakes and work on yourself. Be motivated and soldier through those things."

,,King_Cipher,,,,,"I was once supposed to set up a confrence room for a Sony Executive to come in and give a speech. He had a laptop whose input couldn‚Äôt work with what I had and couldn‚Äôt find what I needed. 

I was chewed out badly for it and later asked the boss if I could resign in private. I‚Äôm ashamed because I liked the environment in the office there.

In my newest one it was a train of not being able to place clothes fast enough, being overburdened to the point of unable to work in organizing a mess (thanks Black Friday), followed by missing the next day which was an inspection day, followed by being caught applying for jobs on what was supposed to be my last day.

I was asked to leave. Even though others do the same  shit. 

It‚Äôs still a resignation I guess but it feels like being fired for the first time. 

I‚Äôm at a very low point and I‚Äôve been trying to keep myself from thinking about it because I want to go back to smash my old store up as a customer."

,,Styloburner,,,,,"Take a minute to figure out what you want to do. You're still very young career wise. Think about interests. Maybe take a class at a community college to see if there is anything you like. If I could do it over again, I probably would have looked into being a car mechanic.

If you need a job of some kind in the meantime, try to find something you like. Example: If you like art, work in art store. And use your extra time to figure out what you want to do long term.

Also, don't beat yourself up about it. Forgive yourself. It's just a job. There is another one down the road. Learn from it and move on."
,,,,,,,"it's still in the first one or 2 years of your career, which is supposed to suck. I think the important thing is to strive and succeed in whatever you're doing now or next, and not be hung up on the thought that past performance is an indication of future performance, it's not."
,,King_Cipher,,,,,"Faiked to get my store up to standards for a inspection that I was informed was going to happen the very next day. Followed by sleeping in in said day. Being too embarrassed and tired to care any more. Not responding to texts from bosses. Putting in a 2 week notice. Being told when you come back that you don‚Äôt need to come in the last 2 weeks due to management knowing I don‚Äôt want to be there. And then being caught applying for jobs on my phone.

Which proves there point more than mines. 

It‚Äôs just a train of bad decisions that make me wonder why I‚Äôm even alive if I can‚Äôt even do a simple retail job or soldier through it. But I just can‚Äôt stand the work if it or any other job."
,,King_Cipher,,,,,"Not sure. I like video games, relaxed atmospheres, and aggressive dedication but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an artist. Other than entertainment my other hobby is to read the news obsessively. But I don‚Äôt know if jobs in that area and being a journalist doesn‚Äôt seem to be rewarding.

One job that took my interests lately is a Sterilization Tech because all you need is a certificate and then potentially get a 20$ an hour job."

,,the-north_remembers,,,,,"Just out of curiosity, is a masters degree an option?

Edit: just saw sentence about graduate degree.

If your company is paying for most of it, I would say that the graduate/master‚Äôs degree is a great option. Because you undergrad major is so different, you may need to take a few undergrad level courses that will help bridge the knowledge you will need for graduate school."
,,uchiha-gohan,,,,,I have an Econ degree and I‚Äôm fascinated to hear how you got into Engineering OP
,,,,,,,"Why cant you use your economics degree?

Nothing wrong with going back to school. If you have responsibilities it may just be abit more of a challenge. Otherwise go for it"
,,thejezzajc,,,,,"You can definitely do it, but first ask yourself why.  What specifically is the pay off?  What doors are you sure will open that are closed at the moment?  What other qualifications or certifications short of a full on degree might open those doors? 

Don't do it if you've just got a vague idea that it might be helpful unless you're genuinely interested in doing it for the sake of doing it, regardless of whether it helps your career."
,,npd_reflect,,,,,"If your company will pay for it that's a great deal.  

>Is it even possible to pursue an Engineering degree entirely through night classes?

Yes.  Depends on the school.  Online could be another option."
,,InQuireR123,,,,,"It's a long story, but I'll try to keep it brief.

I graduated into a bad economy and had difficulty finding an analyst position in my field. Despite sending out resume after resume, I heard nothing back and began to feel as though my efforts were meaningless.

I settled for a low paying position that partly involved equipment repair. Some aspects of the job sucked, but I came to really enjoy the process of diagnosing a failure with a machine and tinkering with it until it was whole again. Overall, the job was okay, but my career prospects were extremely limited there and so I left to try a different opportunity. 

I had high hopes for this new position. It still wasn't in my field and it didn't pay all that much better, but it at least had the potential to do so once I had gotten more experience under my belt.

I'll spare you the detailed, but, long story short, it was a frickin' nightmare filled with poor training, long hours, and unsafe working conditions. I quit after a month. It just wasn't worth it.

I knew I was in a somewhat precariously position as I had quit my job with nothing lined up, but I wasn't too keen on returning to my old position either, so I put my nose to the grindstone and applied to anything that seemed like it might fit my qualifications. 

Within two weeks, I had 3 job offers on the table. Two were permanent, but the temp position paid the most and was the closest. Oddly enough, the temp position also seemed like it would confer the best experience, so I went out on a limp and opted for that.

The assignment put me into a position where I was regularly work with and interacting with engineers and would occasionally be given tasks that were sort of low-hanging engineering fruit. 

As the end of my assignment drew near, my boss really wanted to keep me, but said he didn't have room in the budget for a permanent position (which I knew going in), but told me there was an opening for an engineering technician in another department that I would be suited for; offering to put in a good word for me as well.

As luck would have it, I was able to land that position and so, here we are."
,,uchiha-gohan,,,,,"That‚Äôs really fascinating! When I graduated in 2016 I had a VERY hard time finding a job related to my degree as well. I had some kind of hang up about going through the steps to apply for public sector jobs but that is probably what I should have done. I ended up going into insurance and although I enjoy it a lot, there‚Äôs not a lot of money to be made without owning an agency and taking on all the risk yourself. 

I have a friend who is an Electrical Engineer at Texas Instruments doing failure analysis. When I look at his gig I definitely think I would‚Äôve gone that route if I could go back and change my major as a sophomore. So you being in engineering is really cool. I would say that‚Äôs the better of the two fields. 

Tough to say what your next step should be if you want to make more money. I would say the engineering degree might be more guaranteed success but also a longer route. Getting a masters in something more related to Econ might be an easier route that could potentially earn you the money you‚Äôre looking to make but you‚Äôre right about not having experience. That actually will make a difference unfortunately. Your experience thus far will count for something, but if they have a choice between a someone with a masters and an engineering background, or someone with a masters and an analyst background, they are probably going to pick the latter - the job market is pretty dog-eat-dog. Is it even possible to just go for a masters in engineering with a non-engineering undergrad degree? (Genuinely asking, cause that makes the most sense if you‚Äôre able to). At the end of the day you just gotta go with your gut and pick whichever one you really want to do for the rest of your life. No shame in taking 8 years to get another bachelors, but the caveat there is that you will be busy a lot for a long time and I would also say you NEED to like your current job if you‚Äôre gonna bust ass at school during your off time. Don‚Äôt want to end up hating your life and just ditching the whole thing."
